Dr Nick Wilson
Dr Nick Wilson
Nick is a sociolinguist whose research interests include interactional and variationist strands of sociolinguistics. Nick completed his Undergraduate and Masters degrees at the University of Edinburgh, where he studied Linguistics, English Language and Anthropology. He then went onto complete a PhD at Victoria University of Wellington on the linguistic construction of leadership and team identity in a New Zealand rugby team. Following this, Nick returned to the UK, teaching first at the University of Manchester: on Bilingualism and Language Contact; then at Cardiff University, where he has been working up until coming to Macquarie. At Cardiff, Nick taught a variety of units such as: Sociolinguistics, Research Methods, Discourse Analysis, and Literary Stylistics. 
Nick's recent and current research includes: communication training with homeless footballers in Wales; sociolinguistic variation of the pre-vocalic definite article; and finding the perfect half-time team talk. He is also co-authoring a new edition of An Introduction to Sociolinguistics with Janet Holmes.
Nick is interested in any research that investigates language in sport, leadership discourse, or language variation and change.
