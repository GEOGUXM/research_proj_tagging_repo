About us
Our Team
The Reproductive Medicine Research Group is based within the School of Women's and Children's Health at UNSW Medicine and also has strong links with the Department of Reproductive Medicine at the Royal Hospital for Women in Sydney and with IVF-Australia Research and Development.
Our research profile is highly translational, with major interests in molecular oocyte biology and oocyte-follicle interaction leading on to clinical studies on embryo implantation and ectopic pregnancy, treatment of infertility and disorders of ovulation such as polycystic ovary syndrome and premature ovarian failure. We are also interested in natural ovarian ageing and the decline in fertility seen with advancing female age. In addition, there are major programmes of research into gynaecological surgery for benign disorders and, in collaboration with Sydney Children's Hospital, into improving methods for fertility preservation for young people with cancer.
Our group comprises a mix of basic and clinical researchers with a major teaching role for clinical and bio-science students at undergraduate and postgraduate level. We run an active Masters and PhD programme and have funding from NHMRC, ARC and charitable sources.
