Ciao! I am a research staff member at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heigths, NY. I like working on multimedia processing, video analysis, indexing and retrieval, computer vision and pattern recognition.
Before joining IBM I received my MS and PhD degrees from the department of Computer Science at Columbia University, advised by Professor John Kender, in 2008 and 2012, respectively. Before coming to NYC I graduated with a BS and MS in Telecommunications Engineering from the University of Trento in Italy in 2004 and 2007. In 2005/06 I also spent a year at the University of California San Diego as an exchange student.
