H. Ding, L. Huang, Y. Liu, and J. Li, `` K-Means Clustering with Distributed Dimensions,"  Accepted to the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2016) . We study the popular k-means clustering problem in the environment that the dimensions are distributed, and our algorithmic framework matches the approximation ratio by the recent [Cohen et al. STOC 2015], but has a much lower communication complexity.
