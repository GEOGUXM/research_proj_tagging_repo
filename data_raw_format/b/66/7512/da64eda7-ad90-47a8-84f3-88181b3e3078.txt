Hu Ding
I join the department of computer science and engineering at Michigan State University in 2016, as a tenure-track assistant professor. I got my Ph.D under supervision of Dr. Jinhui Xu,  in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo, in Sep 2015. I received my bachelor degree in Mathematics from Sun Yat-Sen (Zhong Shan) University in Jun 2009. My research centers around designing efficient geometric algorithms and emphasizes both theoretical development and their applications in real world.
I am looking for motivated Ph.D students who are interested in theory/algorithms starting from Fall 2017

We study the popular k-means clustering problem in the environment that the dimensions are distributed, and our algorithmic framework matches the approximation ratio by the recent [Cohen et al. STOC 2015], but has a much lower communication complexity.
