He is interested in elemental speciation: (1) using field-based solid phase extraction (SPE) devices and methods of elemental removal (especially As, Sb, V and U) from ground and surface waters; and (2) biomedical applications relating to health diagnosis and treatment, e.g. Se and Zn in blood serum and infertility cases.<br><br>He has studied the involvement of trace and ultra-trace elements in human fluids and tissues for more than 35 years in relation to many human disorders, especially pre-conceptual problems, birth defects, infertility, hyperactivity and anti-social behaviour in children, and numerous metabolic and neurological diseases.<br><br>The ICP-MS Facility he oversees (since 1990) has been involved in many international environmental incidents, including Chernobyl, Camelford, the Gloucester chemical fire (2000), the London Orbital (M25) motorway and the Newbury (A34) bypass. One of his main research areas has been the study of heavy metal pollution from motorways in many countries around the world since 1973; especially the long term effects of Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Pt in storm water drainage facilities and motorway corridor surface soils and plants. In recent years, the group has evaluated the chemical characterisation and dispersion of elements relating to volcanic eruptions in Chile and Argentina.<br><br>He sits on the editorial board of the 6 international journals on analytical/environmental or trace element medical research and is a member of Council for ISTERH (International Society For Trace Element Research in Humans).</p><p>In 2007, he was awarded the prestigious Donald MacLaren Award by WACE for innovation, administration and international development of work integrated learning programmes. He was for 20 years the Senior Professional Training (or Industrial Work-based Learning/Cooperative Education) Tutor for Chemistry and since 1997 a University of Surrey representative of WACE (World Association for Cooperative CooP Education). In 2007 he became the Chairman of the Professional Training and Careers Committee (PTCC - until 2015) which oversees the delivery of the PTY placement programmes for more than 800 UG students. He is an enthusiastic supporter of personal development, especially incorporating skills and competency activities into all levels of undergraduate and postgraduate education. He has been actively involved in the development and administration of global student exchange programmes for work-based learning over the last 30 years and is involved in student CooP exchange programmes with Australia, New Zealand, Canada, USA, Japan and in the near future, South America.</p></div></div><div id="research-tab" class="tab genericBox"><div class="genericBox">        <h2>Research Interests</h2>Below you can download a selection of posters detailing some of Prof. Ward's recent research projects.<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="50%">&nbsp;</td><td width="50%"><b>Poster Title</b></td></tr><tr><td width="50%"><a class="fileTypeIcon pptLink" href="http://rhythmyx.surrey.ac.uk:9992/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_contentid=73395&amp;sys_variantid=607&amp;sys_command=edit&amp;sys_folderid=47461&amp;sys_context=0" sys_contentid="73395" sys_variantid="607" unselectable="on" contenteditable="false"><span class="fileLink">Poster 1</span></a> <span class="fileLink">(12132.5KB)</span></td><td width="50%">Field-Based Arsenic Speciation in Water Samples and the Relationship to Human Health</td></tr><tr><td width="50%"><a class="fileTypeIcon pptLink" href="http://rhythmyx.surrey.ac.uk:9992/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_contentid=73396&amp;sys_variantid=607&amp;sys_command=edit&amp;sys_folderid=47461&amp;sys_context=0" sys_contentid="73396" sys_variantid="607" unselectable="on" contenteditable="false"><span class="fileLink">Poster 2</span></a> <span class="fileLink">(1880.0KB)</span></td><td width="50%">Arsenic Speciation Analysis of Geothermal<br>Waters in New Zealand</td></tr><tr><td width="50%"><a class="fileTypeIcon pptLink" href="http://rhythmyx.surrey.ac.uk:9992/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_contentid=73397&amp;sys_variantid=607&amp;sys_command=edit&amp;sys_folderid=47461&amp;sys_context=0" sys_contentid="73397" sys_variantid="607" unselectable="on" contenteditable="false"><span class="fileLink">Poster 3</span></a> <span class="fileLink">(901.0KB)</span></td><td width="50%">The Measurement of Boron in the Environment and Human Hair in relation to Argentina, South America</td></tr><tr><td width="50%"><a class="fileTypeIcon pdfLink" href="http://rhythmyx.surrey.ac.uk:9992/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_contentid=73399&amp;sys_variantid=607&amp;sys_command=edit&amp;sys_folderid=47461&amp;sys_context=0" sys_contentid="73399" sys_variantid="607" unselectable="on" contenteditable="false"><span class="fileLink">Poster 4</span></a> <span class="fileLink">(1708.2KB -

Houk) during the early 1980s. In 2010, a new Agilent 7700X instrument was installed in the ICP-MS Facility, the forth instrument in Chemistry, maintaining the longest history of academic research in this analytical field in the world. &nbsp;The new instrument has many exciting features, including a collision cell that enables many trace elements that are of clinical and environmental interest, namely Se, Cr, V, As, Cu, Zn and Mo to be determined at very low ultra-trace levels (µg/l), without concerns about polyatomic interferences. The enhanced sensitivity across the mass range (from boron to uranium) provides an excellent opportunity for researchers across the university and on an international level to undertake collaborative research projects in many fields, from materials, food quality, forensic, drug discovery, bioinorganic (chemical speciation), water/environmental and clinical/health diagnosis and treatment, etc. At present the new instrument is the focal point of supporting projects in Chemical Sciences relating to collaborators from Brazil, Argentina, Greece, Cyprus, Canada, Iraq, Singapore and Pakistan.</p><p>Some of Prof. Ward’s research publications in this area are:<br>(i) RAYMAN, M.P., ABOU-SHAKRA, F.R., WARD, N.I., 1996.

Health. 32(6), 479-90.<br><br>A major feature of the ICP-MS Facility is the training of young analytical chemists who are introduced to the ‘real world’ of ICP-MS. This involves being able to understand all the major components of the instrument, including modifications to the hardware so as to be fit for the purpose of the specific analysis being undertaken, instrument maintenance and software/data manipulation and interpretation.<br><b><br>Special Analytical Features: Field based SPE Arsenic Speciation Analysis<br></b>In 2006, a collaborative research study was started to apply a new field-based solid phase extraction (SPE) methodology for the separation and quantification of arsenic (total and the 4 main species – As3+, As5+, MA and DMA) in ground waters from various regions of central/Andes Argentina. Moreover, data was obtained for physiochemical parameters (pH, electric conductivity, total dissolved solids, temperature) and arsenic (total and speciation) in filtered and unfiltered groundwater samples from San Juan, La Pampa, Rio Negro and Neuquén provinces. The unique features of this study, when compared with previous research in the field of arsenic speciation analysis of ground water, relate to the SPE methodology used. Field-based separation and preservation of the As species at the time of sample collection in Argentina eliminates any concerns arising from the conventional determination of arsenic species in ground water (O’Reilly et al., 2010; Watts et al., 2010).<br><br>Sample collection, preservation, transport and storage stages, before arsenic species separation and detection using HPLC-ICP-MS (or other hyphenated techniques), are still fraught with potential problems. Moreover, many studies use mathematical calculations or pre-analysis chemical modifications to estimate the arsenic species levels in ground waters. For example, in two major studies reporting As speciation data of groundwater in Argentina: (1) “at the time of collection samples for As3+ analysis were acidified to pH 4 (HCl) and subsequently to 2% v/v (HCl) for total As. As3+ analysis (in the United Kingdom) was completed as soon as possible, that is within 2 weeks of collection in Argentina”; (2) “analyses for As3+ were carried out using samples filtered through Disposable Cartridges® and acidified with 14M HNO3. The concentrations of As5+ were later determined by calculating the differences between total As and As3+ in the samples. Since the samples were acidified with 14M HNO3, the possible ICP-MS interferences of the atomic masses of ArCl and As were eliminated”. Interestingly, no validation data was reported for these methods. The field based SPE methodology for arsenic speciation in the 2006-9 study utilises two solid phase extraction cartridges, namely, a Varian 500 mg Junior Bond Elut® strong cation exchange (SCX) and strong anion exchange (SAX). &nbsp;All samples (typically 30 cm3) were filtered with a 0.45 μm filter before separation. &nbsp;Validation of the SPE field-based arsenic speciation method was undertaken using HPLC-ICP-MS (Watts et al. 2010), to confirm the presence of the individual arsenic species in their respective fractions. Filtered and acidified (F/A) water samples for total arsenic analysis and fractionated water samples from the SPE field-speciation method were analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Agilent 7500 Series, Agilent Technologies, UK). &nbsp;Arsenic detection was performed in collision cell mode using 4 l /min He to minimise polyatomic interferences at m/z 75 such as 40Ar35Cl+. The limit of detection (LOD) for arsenic by ICP-MS for each of the 4 arsenic species by HPLC-ICP-MS was reported as As3+: 0.14 μg/l, DMA: 0.15 μg/l, MA: 0.12 μg/l and As5+: 0.10 μg/l.<br><br>This methodology confirmed that for the first time arsenic speciation analysis of ground water could be undertaken with a high level of confidence because errors from conventional sample collection and laboratory analysis technologies were reduced or eliminated (Watts et al., 2010). Moreover, with the detection of arsenic using ICP-MS at a detection limit &nbsp;of 0.1 µg/l, 100 times below the WHO recommended drinking limit of 10 µg/l As, it was possible to obtain accurate data on arsenic (total and species) for a variety of different ground waters in Argentina (O’Reilly et al., 2010).</p><p><b>Quality Control Assessment of Analytical Procedures Used for Determining Trace and Ultra Trace Element Levels</b></p><p><br>The ICP-MS Facility regularly evaluates all analytical activities by measuring reference materials, and is involved in inter-laboratory and inter-analytical method comparisons for trace element measurements.

The 1-day conference was held at INTA.E.E.A., San Juan, Argentina and had more than 120 delegates.<br><br>The province of San Juan, Argentina has a desert-continental climate with very little rainfall. The main agricultural activity is the wine industry with grape production being of fundamental importance to the local economy. The Andes mountain range provides, via a series of river systems, the major source of water to support this agricultural activity. In particular, the Rio San Juan and Rio Jachal are very important sources and as such the water quality is vital to support the grape, and other food crop, production of the province. The region of Jachal has a major network of rivers and dams providing the water supply for the area. The water contains higher than normal levels of various elements (boron, arsenic) and electrolytes (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, etc) and as such has brought about a scientific need to research the quality of the regional water supplies and the potential impact on agriculture and human health.<br><br>Throughout 2005-10 the ICP-MS Facility has started undertaking a major environmental impact assessment of boron and the other chemicals in this region. In collaboration with scientists from INTA, INA, local universities and commercial companies a ‘Boron Network’ has been established to undertake future research studies on the impact of boron on water quality, agricultural production (especially wine) and human health.<br><br>In 2006, a major research programme was started in relation to field based arsenic speciation analysis of waters in Argentina in collaboration with Dr Michael Watts of British Geological Survey (and subsequently in Greece, New Zealand, Cyprus and Iraq).<br><i><br>Arsenic Speciation Data for Groundwater in Argentina</i><br>In summary, the 2006-9 study focused on the arsenic speciation analysis of ground waters from two agricultural towns in La Pampa, the rural community of Encon (San Juan) and an agricultural community in Rio Negro. In all cases the water samples were obtained directly from wells. Total arsenic levels in La Pampa (central Argentina within the Chaco-Pampean Plain) ranged from 3 – 1326 μg /l As. &nbsp;The highest total arsenic levels were found in well waters (from both rural farms and pre-treated urban sources), particularly with high pH (typically &gt; 8.2), conductivity (&gt; 2600 μS/cm) and TDS (&gt; 1400 ppm). La Pampa ground waters displayed As3+ and As5+ levels of 100 – 466 μg/l and 1.5 – 132 μg/l, respectively. &nbsp;Monomethylarsonic acid was detectable in some ground waters (up to 79 μg/l MA). &nbsp;Very low levels of dimethyl arsinic acid ranged from &lt; 0.15 – 1.4 μg/l &nbsp;DMA.<br><br>Encon (southern San Juan) is predominantly set upon Quaternary continental deposits. &nbsp;The geological composition of the sampling area would suggest similar arsenic levels to those found in La Pampa. The well water pH conditions ranged from 9.3 – 9.7; conductivity levels of 972 – 1603 μS/cm and TDS, 526 – 1346 ppm. The total As levels were 21 – 353 μg /l As. &nbsp;Encon well waters contained a significantly higher percentage of As3+: community drinking water 86% As3+ (mean 323 μg/l) and 7 % As5+ (mean 27 μg/l); rural farm livestock watering/ irrigation &nbsp;99 % As3+ (mean 57 μg/l), with the remaining 1 % made up of the three other species. Previous studies on the levels of arsenic in waters in La Pampa have mainly reported As5+ as the main species. This finding was deduced from the subtraction of As3+ from the total arsenic level. This subtraction method does not account for organoarsenic species and may provide false positive concentrations for As5+. &nbsp;The use of SPE cartridges that have the ability to separate and retain the individual aqueous arsenic species (inorganic and organic) in the field provides a much more reliable method for their detection in environment samples.</p><p><i>Chemical Evaluation of the Rio Negro and Rio Colorado, Patagonia, Argentina</i><br>During 2005-8, two major chemical research investigations were made of the water quality of the Rio Negro and Rio Colorado systems in northern Patagonia, Argentina.

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p style="display: none;">Objective: Very little is known about the relationship between postnatal methylmercury concentrations (via toenails as bioindicator) and behavioural characteristics of Pacific Island children living in New Zealand. The aim of this study was to explore the association between total mercury exposure and different domains of behavioural problems in Pacific children.  Materials and Methods: A sample of nine-year-old Pacific Island children resident in Auckland, New Zealand participated in this study. Total mercury was determined in biological samples (toenail clippings) on behavioural problems as identified by mothers (using the child behaviour checklist). Specific behavioural domains, particularly aggression, rule breaking, attention and social problems were studied in relation to mercury exposure using toenails. The determination of mercury concentration in toenail clippings, after acid digestion was carried out using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  Results: The observational study was conducted between July 2010 and July 2011 in which 278 eligible nine-year-old Pacific Island children were enrolled (Girls n= 58%; boys n=42%). Findings showed that 21% of the children had total toenail mercury concentrations (1.5 µg/g to 6 µg/g) higher than the United State Environmental Protection Agency recommended levels (RfD; 1 µg/g Hg) for optimal health in children. Aggressive behaviour was associated with total toenail mercury exposure after adjusting for gender, ethnicity and income levels (OR: 2.15 95% CI 1.45, 3.18 p-value&lt; 0.05; OR 1.38 95% CI 0.83, 1.2 p value &lt;0.05, respectively).   Conclusions: Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of total toenail mercury concentrations for Pacific people in New Zealand using toenail clippings as biomarkers in terms of associations with child behavioural problems. Mercury in toenails demonstrated a moderate association with a specific behavioural domain – aggressive behaviour.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p style="display: none;">The human body requires certain amount of trace elements to function properly (especially those that are classified
as essential to health). Most elements are co-factors in the molecular mechanisms within the body but when in excess
can also cause toxicity. Concentrations of some elements in excess (above optimum) or deficient amount can progress
to some types of metabolic abnormalities which could lead to obesity. Obesity is a multifactorial condition with
multiple pathways including environmental, dietary, and genetic. All these factors, including elemental abnormalities
can disrupt the molecular mechanisms. Whilst there is evidence that obesity causes several elemental deficiencies, there
is lack of knowledge on how these elemental deficiencies are related to an obese individual. This review examined the
literature to determine if there are biological reasons to believe that low or increased concentrations of certain trace
elements, namely, copper, magnesium, iodine, cobalt, molybdenum, boron, antimony, aluminium, chromium, selenium,
manganese, calcium, zinc and iron might be associated with increased body fat.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p style="display: none;">The arsenic speciation analysis of water (surface and ground) was undertaken in thirteen provinces of Argentina. A field-based method utilizing solid phase extraction cartridges enabled the selective retention of iAs III, iAsV, MAV and DMAV. All fractions and a 'total' arsenic acidified sample were analyzed by ICP-MS using a collision cell. Total arsenic levels varied from &lt;0.2 to 6754 μg L -1, with the highest levels in Neuquén (surface) and in Santiago del Estero and La Pampa (ground). The lowest total As levels were found in Misiones and Chubut (surface; &lt;0.2 μg L-1). Speciation levels varied depending on water type, pH and redox potential. In San Juan and Neuquén, the predominant species is iAsIII (surface) whereas in La Pampa (ground) there is variation: Eduardo Castex (iAsIII &gt; iAsV), Ingeniero Luiggi (iAsIII ∼ iAsV), San Martin (iAsIII &lt; iAsV). In Buenos Aires and Santa Fe (ground), the main As species is iAsV. © 2014 Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p style="display: none;">Gunshot Residue (GSR) is residual material from the discharge of a firearm, which frequently provides crucial information in criminal investigations. Changes in ammunition manufacturing are gradually phasing out the heavy metals on which current forensic GSR analysis is based, and the latest Heavy Metal Free (HMF) primers urgently demand new forensic solutions. Proton scanning microbeam Ion Beam Analysis (IBA), in conjunction with the Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with an Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (SEM-EDS), can be introduced into forensic analysis to solve both new and old problems, with a procedure entirely commensurate with current forensic practice. Six cartridges producing GSR particles known to be interesting in casework by both experience and the literature were selected for this study. A standard procedure to relocate the same particles previously analysed by SEM-EDS, based on both secondary electron (SE) and X-ray imaging was developed and tested. Elemental Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) mapping of the emitted X-rays allowed relocation in a scan of 10μm×10μm of even a 1μm GSR particle. The comparison between spectra from the same particle obtained by SEM-EDS and IBA-PIXE showed that the latter is much more sensitive at mid-high energies. Results that are very interesting in a forensic context were obtained with particles from a cartridge containing mercury fulminate in the primer. Particle-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE) maps of a particles from HMF cartridges allowed identification of Boron and Sodium in particles from hands using the 10B(p,α1γ)7Be, 11B(p,p1γ)11B and 23Na(p,p1γ)23Na reactions, which is extraordinary in a forensic context. The capability for quantitative analysis of elements within individual particles by IBA was also demonstrated, giving the opportunity to begin a new chapter in the research on GSR particles. The integrated procedure that was developed, which makes use of all the IBA signals, has unprecedented characterisation and discrimination power for GSR samples. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p style="display: none;">The effect of vacuum exposure on latent fingerprint chemistry has been evaluated. Fingerprints were analysed using a quartz crystal microbalance to measure changes in mass, gas chromatography mass spectrometry to measure changes in lipid composition and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) to determine changes in the content of water, fatty acids and their esters after exposure to vacuum. The results are compared with samples aged under ambient conditions. It was found that fingerprints lose around 26% of their mass when exposed to vacuum conditions, equivalent to around 5 weeks ageing under ambient conditions. Further exposure to vacuum causes a significant reduction in the lipid composition of a fingerprint, in particular with the loss of tetradecanoic and pentadecanoic acid, that was not observed in ambient aged samples. There are therefore implications for sequence in which fingerprint development procedures (for example vacuum metal deposition) are carried out, as well as the use of vacuum based methods such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI) in the study of fingerprint chemistry. © 2013 .</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p style="display: none;">Imaging and analyzing gunshot residue (GSR) particles using the scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDS) is a standard technique that can provide important forensic evidence, but the discrimination power of this technique is limited due to low sensitivity to trace elements and difficulties in obtaining quantitative results from small particles. A new, faster method using a scanning proton microbeam and Particle Induced X-ray Emission (μ-PIXE), together with Elastic Backscattering Spectrometry (EBS) is presented for the non-destructive, quantitative analysis of the elemental composition of single GSR particles. In this study, the GSR particles were all Pb, Ba, Sb. The precision of the method is assessed. The grouping behaviour of different makes of ammunition is determined using multivariate analysis. The protocol correctly groups the cartridges studied here, with a confidence &gt;99%, irrespective of the firearm or population of particles selected.</p>

<p style="display: none;">The effect of vacuum exposure on latent fingerprint chemistry has been evaluated. Fingerprints were analysed using a quartz crystal microbalance to measure changes in mass, gas chromatography mass spectrometry to measure changes in lipid composition and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) to determine changes in the content of water, fatty acids and their esters after exposure to vacuum. The results are compared with samples aged under ambient conditions. It was found that fingerprints lose around 26% of their mass when exposed to vacuum conditions, equivalent to around 5 weeks ageing under ambient conditions. Further exposure to vacuum causes a significant reduction in the lipid composition of a fingerprint, in particular with the loss of tetradecanoic and pentadecanoic acid, that was not observed in ambient aged samples. There are therefore implications for sequence in which fingerprint development procedures (for example vacuum metal deposition) are carried out, as well as the use of vacuum based methods such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI) in the study of fingerprint chemistry.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p style="display: none;">Total arsenic and four arsenic species; arsenite (iAsIII), arsenate (iAsV), dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV) and monomethylarsonic acid (MAV), are reported in 28 geothermal features from the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) and Waikato region of New Zealand.

This is the first research to present data for arsenic species collected by this technique in geothermal waters from New Zealand. Total arsenic concentrations, determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), ranged from 0.008 to 9.08 mg l-1 As.

Inorganic arsenic species were predominant in the geothermal waters, with arsenite contributing to more than 70% of the total arsenic in the majority of samples. Organic species were also determined in all samples, indicating the presence of microbial activity. A potential risk to human health was highlighted due to the high levels of arsenic, mainly as arsenite, in geothermal features linked to bathing pools.

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p style="display: none;">Cyprus being a Mediterranean island with long dry summers and mild winters suffers from water deficiency and over exploitation of its water resources. Groundwater in Cyprus is a valuable natural resource as approximately 50% of the total water needs come from underground water supplies. According to the Directive 118/2006/EC, groundwater should be protected from deterioration and chemical pollution, this is particularly important for groundwater dependent ecosystems and for the use of groundwater as a water supply for human consumption. During 2007 to 2009, as part of a national monitoring programme, 84 boreholes were sampled in Cyprus and subsequently analysed for total arsenic by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The groundwater concentrations ranged from &lt;0.3 to 41μg/L As. Several boreholes located in a rural farming district near Nicosia had concentrations above the World Health Organisation (WHO) Drinking Water Guideline limit of 10μg/L As. Evaluation of the groundwater sampling procedure for boreholes provided data recommending that water samples should be collected after an initial borehole washout for 5min. Further sampling of these boreholes in 2010, revealed total arsenic concentrations of &lt;0.3-64.2μg/L As, with the predominant arsenic species (determined using a novel field-based methodology) being arsenate (As                         V). The maximum total arsenic concentration is 6-fold higher than the WHO Drinking Water Guideline limit (10μg/L As) and approximately half of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (UN-FAO) irrigational limit of 100μg/L As. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p style="display: none;">Surface water originating from the Copahue volcano crater-lake was analysed for total arsenic and four arsenic species: arsenite (iAs(III)), arsenate (iAs(V)), monomethylarsonic acid (MA(V)) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)) and other trace elements (Fe, Mn, V, Cr, Ni, Zn). A novel in-field technique for the preconcentration and separation of four arsenic species was, for the first time, used for the analysis of geothermal and volcanic waters. Total arsenic levels along the río Agrio ranged from &lt;0.2-3783 μg/l As(T). The highest arsenic levels were recorded in the el Vertedero spring (3783 μg/l As(T)) on the flank of the Copahue volcano, which feeds the acidic río Agrio. Arsenite (H(3)AsO(3)) predominated along the upper río Agrio (78.9-81.2% iAs(III)) but the species distribution changed at lago Caviahue and arsenate (H(2)AsO(4)(-)) became the main species (51.4-61.4% iAs(V)) up until Salto del Agrio. The change in arsenic species is potentially a result of an increase in redox potential and the formation of iron-based precipitates. Arsenic speciation showed a statistically significant correlation with redox potential (r=0.9697, P=0.01). Both total arsenic and arsenic speciation displayed a statistically significant correlation with vanadium levels along the river (r=0.9961, P=0.01 and r=0.8488, P=0.05, respectively). This study highlights that chemical speciation analysis of volcanic waters is important in providing ideas on potential chemical toxicity. Furthermore there is a need for further work evaluating how arsenic (and other trace elements), released in volcanic and geothermal streams/vents, impacts on both biota and humans (via exposure in thermal pools or consuming commercial drinking water).</p>

<p style="display: none;">A new protocol using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) has been developed to identify the deposition order of a fingerprint overlapping an ink line on paper.

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p style="display: none;">Soil and water samples were collected from farmsteads and provincial towns across the provinces of La Pampa and San Juan in Argentina. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used for the determination of iodine in water following addition of TMAH to 1% v/v and soils extracted with 5% TMAH. Iodine in agricultural soils was in the range of 1.3–20.9 mg/kg in La Pampa located in central Argentina and 0.1–10.5 mg/kg in San Juan located in the northwest Andean region of Argentina, compared to a worldwide mean of 2.6 mg/kg. Mean selenium concentrations for soils from both provinces were 0.3 mg/kg, compared to a worldwide mean of 0.4 mg/kg. The majority of soils were slightly alkaline at pH 6.7 to 8.8. The organic content of soils in La Pampa was 2.5–5.9% and in San Juan 0.1–2.3%, whilst, mobile water extractable soil-iodine was 1–18% for La Pampa and 2–42% for San Juan. No simple relationship observed for pH and organic content, but mobile iodine (%) was highest when organic content was low, higher for lower total iodine concentrations and generally highest at pH &gt; 7.5. Water drawn for drinking or irrigation of a variety of crops and pasture was found to range from 52 to 395 µg/L iodine and 0.8 to 21.3 µg/L selenium in La Pampa and 16–95 µg/L iodine and 0.6 to 8.2 µg/L selenium in San Juan. The water samples were all slightly alkaline between pH 8 and 10. Water–iodine concentrations were highest at pH 7.8 to 8.8 and in groundwaters positively correlated with conductivity. Raw water entering water treatment works in La Pampa was reduced in iodine content from approximately 50 µg/L in raw water to 1 µg/L in treated drinking water, similar to levels observed in regions experiencing iodine deficiency.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p style="display: none;">The arsenic speciation analysis of ground water was undertaken in southern La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces of Argentina. These regions have been reported to have high levels of arsenic in waters resulting from the layers of volcanic ash within the Chaco-Pampean plain. Forty wells were sampled adjacent to ruta 35 between San Martin (La Pampa) and San German (Buenos Aires). A field-based method utilising solid phase extraction cartridges enabled the selective retention of iAsIII, iAsV, MAV and DMAV. All fractions and a ‘total’ arsenic AsT acidified sample were analysed by ICP-MS using a collision cell. Total arsenic levels varied from 23.0 to 289.0 μg L-1, with the highest levels in La Pampa. Urban well waters from San Martin and San German were well above the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for drinking water (10 μg L-1 AsT). Speciation levels varied depending on province, type of well, conductivity and redox potential (Eh); but not pH. In this study for rural wells arsenite (iAsIII) was the predominant species, whereas for urban wells in Buenos Aires it was arsenate iAsV.</p>

In addition, several students are placed in European and Worldwide chemical companies.<br><br>Since 1987, the key components developed by Prof. Ward are:</p><ul><li>Two unique modules on Scientific Communication to develop and enhance student proficiency in the main core competencies used in Professional Training and for future careers;</li><li>P-credit schemes for BSc(Hons) and MChem degree programmes, involving the assessment framework for both academic and industrial partners;</li><li>Industry Day as a formal post-industrial student assessment programme involving industry, Careers/CLD and other PT tutors;</li><li>The development of a web-based administrative system for the operation of the Professional Training programme in Chemistry;</li><li>Incorporation of student PT management and self-assessment (logbook), and in 2004, Development of PT Research Project Competencies.</li><li>He has presented papers at nine WACE (World Association for Cooperative Education) and three NZACE (New Zealand Association for Cooperative Education) conferences, and published in the Asia-Pacific Journal of Cooperative Education. He has also presented workshops on the International Coop Student Exchange Programme with a view to using the University of Surrey model for establishing a good practice for ‘Global Network Development of Cooperative Education.’</li></ul><p>In recent years Prof. Ward has been very interested in the development of cooperative education in Argentina, and has presented two papers on work-related learning in South America at WACE conferences.<br>He is at present on the editorial board of the APJCE and an editorial contributor to the International Handbook on Cooperative Education. Since 1997 Prof. Ward has been a University of Surrey representative on WACE (World Association for Cooperative Education) and was, until January 2015, the Chairman of the Professional Training and Careers Committee (PTCC).</p><p><b>Professional Training or Cooperative Education Publications</b></p><ol><li>WARD, N.I., JEFFERIES, A. 2004. ‘The Analytical Club’: A unique cooperative education link between industry and academia.
