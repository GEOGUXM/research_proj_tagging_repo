Lauren Bishop-Fitzpatrick, Ph.D.
Postdoctoral Trainee, Waisman Center
E-mail:  bishopfitzpa@waisman.wisc.edu
Research: 
Lauren Bishop-Fitzpatrick is a NICHD postdoctoral fellow at the Waisman Center and will join the School of Social Work as an assistant professor in fall of 2017.
 Her research focuses broadly on health and disability issues in social work. She is engaged in research in three main areas: (1) examining the role of biological stress response and perceived stress in social functioning in adults with autism spectrum disorder; (2) identifying modifiable predictors of adult outcomes and quality of life in individuals with autism spectrum disorder; and (3) characterizing health outcomes and health disparities in adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. In order to address these topics, she uses a combination of biomarker and psychosocial data from both primary and secondary datasets.
 The goal of this research is to inform the development of interventions to improve functional outcomes, quality of life, and health in adults with autism and other developmental disabilities. Her dissertation research was funded by a highly-competitive Weatherstone Predoctoral Fellowship through Autism Speaks. Bishop-Fitzpatrick’s practice experience includes roles as a counselor in an Extended School Year (ESY) program for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and a group leader for therapeutic social skills groups for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder.
