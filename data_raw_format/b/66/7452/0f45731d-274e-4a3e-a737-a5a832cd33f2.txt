Christopher L. Hamill MD
Department of Orthopaedics
Clinical Associate Professor
Specialty/Research Focus
Orthopaedic Surgery; Spine Surgery
  Overview Research Publications Activities
Professional Summary:
I’m a clinical associate professor with Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and director of Spine Services. My area of specialty training and interest is in Spinal Deformity surgery involving scoliosis, kyphosis and flatback deformities in children and adults.

I am a member of the Scoliosis Research Society where I have sat on the Prevalence & Natural History Committee and the Worldwide Course Committee. I have memberships with the North American spine Society, Western New York Orthopaedic Society and American Medical Association and have had the pleasure of giving lectures on diagnosis, treatments and surgery for a wide variety of spine conditions.

I work as the co-director of Spine Services at Buffalo General Hospital where I oversee clinical, teaching, research and administrative tasks related to spine care. I am actively involved with teaching medical students, orthopaedic residents and fellows in both orthopaedics and neurosurgery.

I have been actively involved in an Adult Deformity study group with a grant given by the North American Spine Society. The emphasis has been on improving outcomes for surgical patients based on patient reported outcomes.
