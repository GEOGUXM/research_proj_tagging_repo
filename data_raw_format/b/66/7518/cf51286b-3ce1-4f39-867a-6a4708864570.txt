Gabriele Ferretti joined Chalmers in 1999. For the first ten years he has been mainly involved in research in quantum field theory and string theory with emphasis on their formal aspects. Since the start of the LHC he has also become interested in phenomenological applications of quantum field theory and model building. He teaches physics courses ranging from classical mechanics to physics beyond the Standard Model. He has been involved in outreach activities with the Gothenburg Science Festival and Universeum.
