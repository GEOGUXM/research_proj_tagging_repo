About
The McBride lab uses natural mosquito populations to study the genomic, molecular, and neural basis of evolutionary adaptation to human hosts. We focus in particular on adaptive changes in behavior. Our goal is to identify specific genetic changes that underlie recently evolved behaviors and then build a complete mechanistic picture of their effects, from gene to molecules to neurons to circuits and finally to behavioral output. The mosquitoes we study are major vectors of human disease and thus we hope that our work will inform new strategies for blocking disease transmission.  We are also interested in understanding how ecological adaptation drives genomic divergence and speciation.
