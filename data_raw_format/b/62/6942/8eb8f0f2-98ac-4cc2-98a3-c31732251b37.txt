Dan Reed
Dan Reed is a Research Biologist in the Marine Science Institute at UCSB. His primary research interests focus on patterns and ecological consequences of natural disturbance in coastal marine ecosystems, the processes by which they recover and the application of this knowledge to restoration programs designed to mitigate impacts caused by human disturbance. Giant kelp forests and seagrass beds have been the focal ecosystems for most of his research, which includes studies on dispersal/connectivity, recruitment, reproduction, population and food web dynamics, community ecology, primary production and trophic interactions.
