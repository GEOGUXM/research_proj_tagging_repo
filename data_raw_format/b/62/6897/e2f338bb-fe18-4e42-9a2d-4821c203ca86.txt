SUMMARY
Milo Shaffer is Professor of Materials Chemistry at Imperial College London, and co-Director of the London Centre for Nanotechnology. He has extensive experience of carbon and inorganic nanomaterials synthesis, modification, characterisation, and application, particularly for nanocomposite and hierarchical systems, including both structural matrices and conducting polymers for electrochemical and photovoltaic applications. Notable recent work includes new, patented methods for the dispersion, surface functionalisation and characterisation of carbon nanomaterials, and new approaches to the synthesis of functionalised oxide nanoparticles in situ. In general, exploitation of nanomaterials is limited by difficulties in synthesis and processing, and research focuses on these problems. Milo has previously spent time working as a materials technology consultant in the areas of new technology development and exploitation, and holds around twenty patents, seven of which are licensed commercially. He has published over 100 peer-reviewed papers with a total of over 7000 citations, h-Index 41. He was awarded the Royal Society of Chemistry Meldola medal in 2005 and a prestigious EPSRC Leadership Fellowship in 2008. He sits on the RSC Materials Chemistry Division Council, and the editorial boards of Chemical Physics Letters and International Materials Reviews. He joined Imperial in 2003 from the University of Cambridge.
