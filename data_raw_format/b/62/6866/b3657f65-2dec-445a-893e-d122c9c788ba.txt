Research Interests
My training is in lifespan developmental psychology, focusing on normal age-related changes in cognition and their differentiation from pathological changes. I have a keen interest in the interindividual variability of cognitive aging, specifically why some individuals experience rapid rates of decline, whereas others experience relatively small changes in functioning. I am interested in the factors that contribute to these individual differences, including risks factors for and early detection of pathological decline, as well as optimizing influences for achieving healthy aging. These interests are reflected in my three main research areas: 1) Intraindividual variability (IIV) in cognitive performance; 2) lifestyle engagement and cognitive performance; and 3) risk factors for cognitive decline. I also have extensive experience working with and analyzing longitudinal datasets, and have developed skills in advanced statistical methods such as multilevel modeling, and bivariate dual change score modeling.
IIV in cognitive performance refers to relatively rapid yet reversible changes in performance (e.g., moment-to-moment variation on a RT task). Among older adults, increased IIV is associated with poorer cognitive performance, neurological conditions, and undesirable structural and functional brain changes, suggesting that IIV is a sensitive measure of neurological integrity. My recent work has demonstrated that IIV in cognitive speed appears to be a fundamental behavioral characteristic associated with growing older, even among healthy adults (Bielak, Cherbuin, et al., 2014). Further, given the demonstrated sensitivity of IIV to predicting cognitive change, my coauthors and I investigated the number of RT trials needed to reliably predict neuropathology in adults, in the hopes of IIV eventually being used in a clinical setting (Bunce, Bielak, et al., 2013). Finally, I was invited to submit a chapter on IIV in attention across the adult lifespan for the Handbook of intraindividual variability across the lifespan, reviewing the current literature in this area, and discussing areas for future growth and direction (Bielak & Anstey, 2015).
The "use it or lose it" hypothesis of cognitive aging predicts that activity engagement in older adulthood stimulates the mind and thus prevents cognitive deterioration. However, research is inconsistent in finding this positive relation. Recently, my colleagues and I have investigated whether differences exist across adulthood in the strength of the relationship between cognitive ability and activity participation. We found the size of the relationship between mental and social activity and cognition did not significantly differ across cohorts in their 20s, 40s, and 60s (Bielak, Anstey, et al., 2012), but the youngest cohort showed the strongest effects in relation to physical activity (Bielak, Cherbuin, et al., 2014). We have also showed variation in activity-cognition associations depending on cognitive domain, activity type, and stage of older adulthood, suggesting that the conclusions regarding activity engagement and cognitive ability are dependent on a series of moderating factors (Bielak, Gerstorf, et al., 2014). I am presently focusing my research on the lack of consensus regarding the best method to assess activity engagement (Bielak, under review), and investigating the feasibility of lifestyle activity interventions to improve cognitive performance.
Although we cannot create a definite list of actions for achieving healthy cognitive aging, we can identify risk factors for pathological cognitive decline and work to reduce those risks. Some of my work in this area includes examining the directionality of relations between depressive symptoms and cognitive decline. We found that the model that allowed depressive symptoms to predict subsequent change in perceptual speed provided the best fit, suggesting that depressive symptoms increase the risk of cognitive decline, rather than vice versa (Bielak, Gerstorf, et al., 2011). We have also investigated the risks associated with the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele (Bunce, Bielak et al., 2014), and traumatic brain injury (Eramudugolla, Bielak et al., 2014).
