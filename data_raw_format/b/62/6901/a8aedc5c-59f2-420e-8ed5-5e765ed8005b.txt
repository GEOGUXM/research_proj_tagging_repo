Research:
Gail Jarvik MD, PhD is the Arno G. Motulsky Endowed Chair in Medicine, Joint Professor of Medicine and Genome Sciences, and Head of the Division of Medical Genetics (only the third since the founding of the division in 1957), an Adjunct Professor of Epidemiology at the UW Medical Center (UWMC) and an Affiliate Member of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. She is a Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences, and has been made a Lifetime National Associate of the National Academies, “In recognition of extraordinary service to the National Academy of Science.” She has been designated “A Local Legend from Washington” by Senator Maria Cantwell, in association with the American Medical Women’s Association and the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Her abilities as a scholar and a leader have been recognized by the National Institutes of Health, for which she chaired the Genomics, Computational Biology and Technology Study Section. In addition to that service, leading the Division of Medical Genetics and actively pursuing her own research, she continues to be a practicing clinician in Internal Medicine and Medical Genetics.
Clinical activity:  Dr Jarvik sees patients in the UW Genomic Medicine clinic.
Trainees:  Dr. Jarvik has trainees at all levels from undergraduate to postdoctoral.
Research:  Dr. Jarvik is interested in the genetic basis of complexly inherited genetic disease and has a long-standing interest in biomedical ethics. In addition to many collaborations, including GWAS studies of multiple phenotypes and exomic analyses of Mendelian disorders, Dr. Jarvik's ongoing research focuses on four major areas:

(1) Genome-wide association study (GWAS) of phenotypes from clinical electronic medical records in the eMERGE consortium. This consortium includes over 40,000 subjects at 9 sites. Phenotypes of interest include Alzheimer disease, white blood cell count, susceptibility to infection, and carotid artery disease.

(2) Genetic predictors of carotid artery disease. In addition to the eMERGE data, Dr. Jarvik uses densely genotyped and phenotyped case-control cohorts to study the genetic epidemiology of carotid artery disease. Lipids, oxidation, and inflammation are areas of interest.

(3) Exomic analysis of lipid disorders in large families. We are using a whole exome approach to identify rare, high penetrance mutations that influence lipid traits. Phenotypes include apolipoprotein B, HDL-C, and phospholipid transfer protein. Large families allow the phenotyping of multiple subjects sharing the same rare variants.

(4) Genomic medicine implementation is a new area of focus.  Dr. Jarvik is a PI of the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Consortia of NHGRI and NCI.  The highly collaborative UW work involves implementation of genomic medicine for colorectal cancer and polyposis patients, including return of incidental genomic findings and formal outcomes measures.
