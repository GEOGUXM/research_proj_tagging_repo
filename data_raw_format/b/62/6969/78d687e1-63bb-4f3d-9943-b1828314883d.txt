Overview
Bio
Jessica Morr joined The University of Sydney Business School in 2008 as a team member for the Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) and Peer Mentoring teams. Since 2009 Jessica has coordinated and managed the growing PASS facilitator team with over 50 facilitators in 26 units of study and over 150 sessions per week. Jessica has, and continues to, facilitate and coordinate the expansion of the program into other Faculties, including the Sydney Law School, whereby PASS supports 8 units, and continues to lend her support to other Peer Learning programs university wide.
As an accredited PASS supervisor, Jessica has made contributions to many external activities to promote the University of Sydney and more specifically, the PASS program. In addition to being awarded a Vice Chancellors Award for Systems that Achieve Excellence in 2011, she has also successfully supported her team through international award applications, has participated in shortlisting international facilitator awards as well as provided consultative advice to teams from other local and international universities. Jessica has also participated in senior panels in the recruitment of new coordinators and staff at other prestigious universities across Australia.
In addition to PASS, in 2010, Jessica implemented the Maths in Business (MIB) Workshops, designed to assist students in familiarising themselves in the mathematics expected of them in the Business School and in different disciplines. Currently supporting over 700 students a semester, the program continues to expand with 4 tutors running over 10 different workshops during 6 weeks of each semester.
