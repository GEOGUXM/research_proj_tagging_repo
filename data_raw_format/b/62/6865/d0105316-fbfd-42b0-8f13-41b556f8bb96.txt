Dr Amanda Achmadi
Amanda Achmadi obtained her doctorate degree in Architecture and Asian Studies at the University of Melbourne in 2007. She also holds a Bachelor degree in Architecture from Parahyangan University (Bandung, Indonesia). Her dissertation explores the role of architectural discourses within the 20th century construction of cultural identity in Bali. Amanda is interested in looking at the interactions between architecture and identity politics and how these unfold in different historical periods: pre-colonial, colonial and postcolonial era. Her main focus is the architectural landscape of Indonesia and Southeast Asian region.
