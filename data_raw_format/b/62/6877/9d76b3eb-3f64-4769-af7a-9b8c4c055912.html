<h4>Publications</h4>

<p class="big-bott"><strong>The Application of Collaboration Models of Family Group Conferencing</strong> (2013): This paper analyzes models of collaboration and the policy of family group conferencing. As the public sector tires to improve its service delivery, innovations are occurring in child protection and child welfare services. Family group conferencing uses many elements of collaboration to empower families, design public private partnerships and keep children safe. Collaborative theories note that efforts to align goals, build trust and mutual respect, be transparent, share resources and understand the issues of interdependence are essential to success.
