Danielle V. Schoon holds a dual Ph.D. in Cultural Anthropology and Middle Eastern Studies from the University of Arizona and a Master's degree in Dance Studies from UCLA. Her thesis explored the role of 'Gypsy' stereotypes in American belly dance performances. Her dissertation entailed 14 months of fieldwork in Turkey, funded by a grant from Fulbright-Hays, and is entitled Becoming Roma: Gypsy Identity, Civic Engagement, and Urban Renewal in Turkey. Her publications include a 2014 article in CITY, "Sulukule is the Gun and We are its Bullets: Urban Renewal and Romani Identity in Istanbul" and "Erasing the Stereotypes Inherent in American Belly Dance" in Habibi Journal on Middle Eastern Dance (out of print).
Danielle has served on the board of Cross-Cultural Dance Resources, Inc. (CCDR) for almost two decades and published several articles in their monthly newsletter. She has studied a diverse range of dance techniques, including Flamenco, Bharata Natyam, and Turkish Roman (Gypsy) dance, and she performed as a professional belly dancer for ten years in Tucson, AZ. A long-term instructor of both dance technique and Dance Studies courses from Kinder Ballet to community college, Danielle joined the OSU Dance faculty in 2015 and teaches a graduate seminar in Ethnographies of Dance and Performance.
