Research
Barani Raman's research interests include computational and systems neuroscience, pattern recognition, sensor-based machine olfaction and bio-inspired intelligent systems. 
His research combines theoretical and electrophysiological approaches to study how brain processes complex sensory signals (especially the olfactory cues), and to identify fundamental principles of neural computation. In parallel, he is also involved with the development of novel neuromorphic devices (such as an 'electronic nose') and algorithms that have potential applications in biomedical, homeland security, robotics and human computer interaction domains.
Biography
Prior to joining Washington University in St. Louis in February 2010, Professor Raman was a joint postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
His lab's electronic nose technology has applications for homeland security
