<p>At Michigan State University, I am a professor of Electrical and Computer 
Engineering and of Mechanical Engineering and of
Computer Science and Engineering.&nbsp; I am the director of BEACON:&nbsp; An 
NSF Center for the Study of Evolution in Action, headquartered at MSU (see 
article below and the very informative BEACON site at 
<a href="http://beacon-center.org/">http://beacon-center.org/</a>
. I also co-direct 
<acronym title="Michigan State University">MSU</acronym>'s <a href="http://garage.cse.msu.edu/">Genetic Algorithms Research and Applications 
Group (<acronym title="Genetic Algorithms Research and Applications Group">GARAGe</acronym>)</a> 
, which is administered jointly by the Department of Electrical and Computer 
Engineering and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.&nbsp; In 
February, 2007, I was awarded the university's highest teaching award, the 
Alumni Club of Mid-Michigan Quality in Undergraduate Teaching Award (pictured on 
right with MSU President Lou Anna Kimsey Simon), followed in 2009 by the 
Michigan Distinguished Professor of the Year Award (from the Presidents Council,

<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;John Koza Makes Historic Bequest of $10.7 Million to BEACON!</h2>
<p>
In December, 2016, BEACON, MSU's College of Engineering, and Michigan State University were delighted to announce that Dr. John R. Koza, had made the largest individual bequest ever to BEACON and MSU's College of Engineering, totalling $10.7 million.  That bequest was above and beyond the earlier gift of $2 million given by Koza to establish the John R. Koza Endowed Chair in Genetic Programming, now held by Prof. Wolfgang Banzhaf. All of us at BEACON are deeply indebted to Dr. Koza, who will leave a legacy at MSU including three endowed chairs, endowed graduate fellowships, and endowed support for many of the field's leading professional activities. As the Father of Genetic Programming, he is indeed assuring the continued thriving of this exciting field.

<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Cedar Technology, Inc., now belongs to SIEMENS!</h2>
<p>
In 2016, control of Red Cedar Technology, Inc., the process automation/optimization company co-founded by Erik Goodman and Ron Averill in 1999, passed to the German giant, Siemens. This happened when Siemens bought CD Adapco, the CFD-oriented company that acquired Red Cedar Technology in 2013. I have not been active in Red Cedar since 2010, when BEACON Center was founded and my duties as director required that I resign as Red Cedar's VP for Technology.

<h2>National Science Foundation Extends BEACON Center for Second 5 Years </h2>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="style1">In August, 2015, the National Science Foundation 
extended BEACON's funding through 2020, allocating an additional $22.5 million
to the center.  BEACON, which now has over 600 members, continues to thrive,
producing hundreds of papers, dozens of additional grants, and many new
Ph.D.'s each year.

<h2>National Science Foundation Funds </h2>
<h2 class="style2">BEACON:&nbsp; An NSF Science and Technology Center for the 
Study of Evolution in Action!!!</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="style1">The National Science Foundation 
announced in February, 2010, that Michigan State University has been awarded one of five 
new highly-coveted Science and Technology Centers, to be called <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">BEACON, an NSF Science &amp; Technology 
Center for the Study of Evolution in Action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></b>The initial award is $25 million for 
five years, and the center funding began on August 1, 2010, renewable once for an additional $25 million. 
<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></b>BEACON will conduct research on 
fundamental evolutionary dynamics in both natural and artificial systems, 
educate a generation of multi-disciplinary scientists in these methods, and will 
improve public understanding of evolution at all levels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>BEACON will focus on evolution as an <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ongoing process</i>, in organisms in the 
laboratory (bacteria, yeast, viruses, etc.), in the field, and with <i>digital 
organisms </i>undergoing evolution in the computer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be directed by Erik D. Goodman, 
Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and will involve more than 
more than thirty faculty researchers at MSU, most in the Colleges of Engineering 
and Natural Science. <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></b>Four universities and more thirty 
additional biologists, engineers and computers scientists will partner with MSU 
in BEACON, from <st1:placename w:st="on">North Carolina</st1:placename>

natural evolutionary processes with computer scientists and engineers who 
harness these processes to solve real-world problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Developers of so-called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">evolutionary algorithms</i> have long 
borrowed high-level concepts from biology to improve problem-solving methods, 
but have not always captured the nuances of natural evolution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Close collaboration with biologists 
studying evolution will promote better modeling and harnessing of the 
process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, studying the 
evolution of artificial systems in the computer can provide biologists insight 
into factors that influence the dynamics of evolution. BEACON will promote the 
transfer of discoveries from biology into computer science and engineering 
design, while using novel computational methods and systems to address complex 
biological questions that are difficult or impossible to study with natural 
organisms. </span>

2008, through 43 full proposals submitted in April, 2009, and NSF site visits to 
eleven finalists last fall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
BEACON team, nearly 70 investigators, collaborated to generate the plans for the 
center.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the lead institution, 
MSU made major commitments of space and other resources to BEACON, and the 
partner universities have also pledged extensive support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>BEACON will be headquartered in MSU's 
Biomedical Physical Sciences Building, in space being remodeled for use by 
BEACON and iCER, the Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research, for which BEACON is 
the biggest customer. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>As Goodman, a long-time researcher and practitioner of engineering 
applications of evolutionary computation, says, "BEACON is multidisciplinary to 
its core, and in addition to making discoveries in basic science and 
applications, will prepare a new generation of researchers with the insight that 
comes from first-hand experimentation with evolution in the lab and in the 
computer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Recognizing the 
commonality of evolutionary dynamics in both contexts will enable studies and 
applications that could not be done in isolation in either biology or

<h2>Earlier Good News: NSF CDI Proposal Approved for "Improving Governance of 
Next-Generation ICT Infrastructure" </h2>
<p>MSU learned in August, 2009, that a joint proposal from Goodman (College of 
Engineering), Johannes Bauer and Kurt DeMaagd, of the College of Communication 
Arts and Sciences, will be funded at about $600,000 over three years. The 
project, under NSF�s Cyber-Enabled Discovery and Innovation Program, will use 
agent-based modeling of the telecommunications infrastructure to first develop a 
model that seeks to reflect adequately many aspects of the market- and 
regulation-driven dynamics of the telecommunications industry. Evolutionary 
computation will be used in two ways: 1) in this first stage, to help to find 
the best structure and parameters to capture the dynamics of this complex 
system, and 2) in the subsequent stage, to search the space of possible 
regulatory mechanisms, seeking those that produce the DESIRED emergent 
properties of this complex system. In the past, many regulatory actions have, in 
fact, produced effects almost directly opposite to those desired. The goal here 
is to capture enough of the underlying relationships among the many agents 
(companies, agencies, market sectors, etc.) that the results of a particular 
regulatory change can be gauged well enough to allow search for good 
combinations of regulations to move the infrastructure in desired directions. 
Goodman will provide expertise in evolutionary computation, and Bauer and 
DeMaagd are experts in telecommunications policy and modeling of the 
telecommunications infrastructure. </p>

<h2>Michigan Distinguished Professor of the Year, 2009 </h2>
<p>Then, on May 14, 2009, I was honored as one of three winners of Michigan 
Distinguished Professor of the Year, by the Presidents Council of the State 
Universities of Michigan. Michigan's fifteen state colleges and universities 
annually nominate one faculty member each for the award, and the selection 
committee picks three to receive the honor. The awards were presented by the 
President's Council at a banquet at the Radisson Hotel in Lansing. </p>

<h2>Brief Bio </h2>
<p>I received the Ph.D. in Computer and Communication Sciences from the 
University of Michigan in 1972, where I was a member of the Logic of Computers 
Group, in which John Holland pioneered the development of genetic 
algorithms.&nbsp; My major professor was Bernie Ziegler, an expert on the theory 
of simulation and on automata theory.&nbsp; In my dissertation research, I 
developed a genetic algorithm (using a floating point representation and 
Gaussian mutation operator) to parameterize a model of the metabolism of a 
bacterial cell undergoing nutritional shifts, and a simple model, using a 
cellular automaton, of a bacterial cell colony based upon these cells.&nbsp; To 
my knowledge, solving for those metabolic rate constants was the first use of a 
genetic algorithm to solve an actual hard problem (i.e., one for which the 
solution was wanted, not just a study of the <acronym title="Genetic Algorithm">GA</acronym> on a test problem).&nbsp; It ran about a 
year (calendar time) and over half a year (CPU time) on an IBM 1800 computer 
(first at <acronym title="University of Michigan">UM</acronym>, then at <acronym title="Michigan State University">MSU</acronym>).</p>
<p>In the 1970's, I developed and taught a course sequence in systems ecology, training hundreds of graduate biology students (and 22 visiting faculty members) in computational and state modeling techniques for biological systems, then working with them in small teams of engineers and biologists to model systems of interest to them. My research was largely funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, and included models of pesticide fate and effects in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. </p>
<p>In the 1980's and 1990's, I directed the A. H. Case Center for Computer-Aided Engineering and Manufacturing, doing research on CAD/CAM/CAE largely funded by industry. In the 90's, I directed the MSU Manufacturing Research Consortium, which conducted industrially sponsored research. My own research primarily involved using genetic algorithms and genetic programming to address engineering problems. I became very active in the evolutionary computation professional community.</p>
<p>From 2002-2010, I taught the Senior Capstone Design course in Electrical and Computer 
Engineering, ECE 480, (http://www.egr.msu.edu/classes/ece480/goodman).  I have recently also taught the 
junior-level course in Professionalism and Ethics, ECE 390. In even-numbered 
years 2000-2008, I co-taught a graduate course in evolutionary computation. I am developing 
an undergraduate specialization in Information and Communication Technology for 
Development (beginning in Africa). I chaired the department's Undergraduate 
Studies Committee for several years, until 2010. For more information on my teaching and 
instructional development activities, click on <a href="Teaching.html">Teaching</a> and on <a href="International.html">International Activities</a>. </p>
<p>My research deals primarily with developing new ways of using evolutionary 
computation to solve problems in engineering design (see <a href="ECResearch.html">Research</a>). In 1999, my research 
colleague, Prof. Ron Averill, and I founded a spinoff company, <a href="RCT.html">Red Cedar Technology</a>) to make our design 
automation technology available to industry. </p>
<p>My research has also included funded work to develop methods to allow teams 
of engineering students (and, ultimately, engineers) distributed around the 
world to collaborate more effectively in solving engineering design problems. 
For more information on that topic, see <a href="International.html">International Activities</a>. </p>
<p>I chaired the first evolutionary computation conference held in Russia, "EvCA'96" at the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow. I was more recently co-General Chair of the 2009 World Summit on Genetic and 
Evolutionary Computation, Shanghai, China. For my Intro to Genetic 
Algorithms tutorial slides, see <a href="GECSummitIntroToGA_Tutorial-goodman.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p>After chairing the executive committee of the International Society for
Genetic and Evolutionary Computation, 2002-2005, I became the founding chair of ACM's Special Interest Group for Genetic and Evolutionary Computation, SIGEVO, in 2005. I continue as a member of that group's Executive Committee.
