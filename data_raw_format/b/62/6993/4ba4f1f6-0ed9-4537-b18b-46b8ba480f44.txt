Personal Statement:

Katie J. Hickerson is a doctoral candidate in Middle Eastern and African history at the University of Pennsylvania. Her research explores the intersection of slavery, religion, and non-European colonialism in the age of European empires. Her dissertation, “Resurrection Politics: Death and the Birth of the Sudans, 1865-1935,” explores the cultural and political history of death in the Sudans and its ramifications in Egypt and the British Empire. This project illuminates the ways that the dead – both the corporeal dead and “socially dead” slaves – animated political life, arguing that the dead and their legacies became crucial sites of struggle in the Nile Valley. Her work centers on three periods of dramatic change and the violent transitions between them: the era of Ottoman and Egyptian colonialism (1865-1885), the rise and fall of the Islamic state known as the Mahdīyya (1881-1898), and the imposition of dual British-Egyptian imperial rule (1898-1935). Her project demonstrates how the many manifestations of death in the Sudans – anthropological accounts of funerary rites, tombs and memorials, and ideals of martyrdom – can shed new light on political life.
