Biography: 
Peter A. Newman is a national and international leader in HIV/AIDS social research and global health. Dr. Newman has particular expertise in the social, behavioral and ethical challenges of biomedical HIV prevention trials and the implementation science of new HIV prevention technologies. He was awarded a Canada Research Chair in Health and Social Justice in 2008. Dr. Newman received the Early Researcher Award from the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation in 2007. He is a former National Institute of Mental Health Postdoctoral Fellow in HIV/AIDS Research at University of California at Los Angeles, where he received the Chancellor’s Award for Postdoctoral Research, and a National Institute on Drug Abuse Pre-doctoral Fellow at the University of Michigan Substance Abuse Research Center.
Dr. Newman has received substantial external funding for his global research program on HIV prevention, healthcare access and discrimination, with a focus on vulnerable populations. His research includes ongoing collaborations with community organizations serving women of color, gay and other men who have sex with men, transwomen, male and female sex workers, and injecting drug users. As lead investigator of the Canadian HIV Vaccine Initiative Team in Social and Behavioral Research on HIV Vaccines, Newman is engaged in research and training collaborations with investigators and trainees in Canada, India, South Africa and Thailand. Dr. Newman’s work also addresses LGBTQ challenges in social work research and education. He has served on the U.S. National Institute of Health’s expert review panels for the AIDS International Training and Research Program and International Clinical, Operations and Health Services Research Training Award for AIDS and TB, and is an active member of the NIH Division of AIDS Behavioral Science Working Group.
Dr. Newman’s teaching interests include qualitative and mixed methods research, HIV/AIDS, structural intervention and sexuality. His practice experience includes over two decades in HIV services and ongoing research consultation and training in North America and South and Southeast Asia.
