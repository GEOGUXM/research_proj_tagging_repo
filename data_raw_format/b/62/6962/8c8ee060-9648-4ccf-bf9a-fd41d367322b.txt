  research overview
The Sharma laboratory has a multifaceted research program focused on answering the question of why some women are predisposed to pregnancy complications.

The hypothesis is that anti-inflammatory intrauterine milieu controlled by cytokines and pregnancy hormones is crucial to fetal development and pregnancy success.
