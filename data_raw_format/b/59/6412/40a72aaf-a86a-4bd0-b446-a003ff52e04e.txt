Biography, Education and Training
I received my Ph.D. in 2006 from the Department of Sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I joined the faculty of the Department of Latin American and Latino/a Studies at UC Santa Cruz in 2010 after having completed a two year University of California Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship with the Women's Studies Department at the University of California, Riverside. Prior to the postdoctoral position, I was an assistant professor of Sociology at Connecticut College and a lecturer for the Department of Sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  

My parents were born and raised in Lima, Peru and moved to the United States in the 1960s. I was born in upstate New York, and we moved to Camarillo, California when I was about three years old. I lived in Camarillo until I left for Santa Clara University. I moved to Santa Cruz from Los Angeles in 2010.

In January 2017, I launched a new radio show called Voces Criticas/Critical Voices on KZSC, 88.1 FM.  This weekly radio program offers a critical reading of the news (local, national, and international) and engages in conversation with public intellectuals, activists, artists, and other community members on relevant social issues facing communities of color.  It currently airs from 5:30PM-6PM on Tuesdays.
