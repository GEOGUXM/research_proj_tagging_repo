2016.03.
2014.04, I mentored master and undergraduate students to accomplish the outstanding scientific findings. The results of this research guidance was highly evaluated, as evidenced by the awards of master students in the national conference of coordination chemistry and workshop of polymer society in Kyushu. I organized Kyushu University-UIUC Kickoff Meeting of ICC Program for Synthesis and Assembly of Reconfigurable Nanocrystals, and brought 5 master students to there. This gave great chances for the students to give presentations in English, discuss in English, and communicate with foreign young researchers, which helped them to construct international research network among young researchers..
