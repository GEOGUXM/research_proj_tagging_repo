Research Interests
I am an Assistant Professor at Pennsylvania State University studying the economics of investing in healthy development. I direct the Prevention Economic Planning and Research Labs within the Department of Human Development & Family Studies.Our work is generally focused on preventing illness and criminal behavior through evidence-based investments in childhood and adolescence. This includes utilizing advanced analytic designs, administrative data and technological solutions to optimize preventive strategies.

This work sits at the intersection of human development, economics and public policy. Our research focuses primarily on (1) strengthening economic evaluations of preventive interventions, (2) facilitating evidence-based policy-making through strategic investments in preventive services, and (3) evaluating the utility of performance-based financing to access new resources for improving health.

Our research is funded by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, National Institute of Nursing Research, National Institute of Child Development as well as the Doris Duke and the Robert Wood Johnson.
I am accepting graduate students for the coming 2015-2016 academic year.
