Academic Interests
As a researcher, I am particularly interested in religious views of how people should behave, how they should interact with others and what they should do with their bodies. This interest extends to both the contemporary and the ancient world, and to much in between.
The subject of my current research, the differing views on male circumcision, allows me to address many of the issues that fascinate me. It is a subject where religion, ethics, masculinity, tradition, sexuality, history, health and beauty all come into play. Through analyzing attitudes towards circumcision, several aspects of contemporary and ancient culture, as well as the interaction between the past and the present, can be better understood.
At the moment, I am looking at a number of issues and questions:
The background of the concept of religion as it is used in contemporary circumcision debates
References to Paul in US medical literature on male circumcision, from the 19th century onwards.
What were Luther’s ideas about circumcision and do they help explain the popular understanding of Paul as having abolished circumcision? (preliminary answer: no)
Why do the metaphorical references to foreskin that occur in the Hebrew Bible (such as foreskinned ears and heart) disappear in the Greek of the Septuagint?
