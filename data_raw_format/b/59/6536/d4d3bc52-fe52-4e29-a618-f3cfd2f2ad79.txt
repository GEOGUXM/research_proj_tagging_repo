Biography
Richard Rigby After completion of his PhD (under Professor Wang Gungwu), Richard joined the Australian foreign service. He was a diplomat for some 26 years, with postings in Beijing (twice), Tokyo, London, Shanghai (as Consul-General) and Israel (as Ambassador).  From 2002-2008 he served as Assistant Director-General in the Office of National Assessments (ONA), responsible for North and South Asia.  He has been at the ANU since then. Trained as a historian, he continued to pursue his scholarly interests throughout his official career, and apart from his book on the May Thirtieth Movement, wrote various reviews, articles and a number of literary translations.
