about
I am a senior lecturer in the Department of Philosophy at the University of St Andrews and part of the Arché Philosophical Research Centre. Previously, I was an Associate Fellow of the Northern Institute of Philosophy and a member of the UConn Logic Group, where I did my Ph.D. under Jc Beall
interests
My research interests are mainly in metaphysics and philosophical logic. My recent work in metaphysics has focused mostly on the relationship between parthood and identity, and related questions in ontology and modality. In philosophical logic, I am interested in the nature of truth and the semantic paradoxes. I am also interested in various related issues in philosophy of religion and philosophical theology.
