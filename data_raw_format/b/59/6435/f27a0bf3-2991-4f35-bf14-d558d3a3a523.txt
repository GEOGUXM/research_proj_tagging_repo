Profile
Visiting PhD student at Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics from September 2012
Scientific  summary  
My current research interests focus on GWAS and genomic prediction based on markers of SNP-Chips and sequence data in Danish dairy cattle populations. The objectives of this PhD project are to investigate how large advantage of sequence data over SNP-chip data in GWAS and genomic prediction, how efficient of different statistics methods in GWAS and genomic prediction and how to exploit the advantage efficiently.
Research  funding
State Scholarship Fund of China (CSC) provide stipend DKK 8,500 per month for a period of 17 month
