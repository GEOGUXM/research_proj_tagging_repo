BIOGRAPHY
Dr. O'Brien received her Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1996. She was in general practice until 2005. In 2008, she completed a residency in small animal Emergency and Critical Care at the Animal Emergency Center in Glendale, WI. Dr. O'Brien joined the University of Illinois after her residency.

TEACHING STATEMENT
Having been out in the private sector straight out of veterinary school, I understand the limitations of most veterinary programs. Everything cannot be learned in four, short years; the learning process does not stop after you graduate. My goal is to give the students practical advice and to help them hone their skills and instincts as a clinician so that they are better prepared when they start their careers.
