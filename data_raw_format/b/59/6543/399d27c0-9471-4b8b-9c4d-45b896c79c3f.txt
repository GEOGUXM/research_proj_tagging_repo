Research
Malaria remains one of the most important parasitic infections globally, posing a significant risk to maternal and child health. Better diagnosis of malaria can have an immediate impact on patient care, and provide a valuable tool to probe the prevalence of disease and host:parasite interactions at the population level. My research is primarily focused on the development and application of molecular diagnostics for the detection of malaria in different public health settings. My lab is engaged in a multidisciplinary collaboration to transfer our diagnostic tests for malaria and other pathogens to a ‘Lab-on-a-Chip’ to be used at the point-of-care in limited-resource areas. I have partnered with international colleagues to pilot our technology in malaria-endemic settings (Uganda, Pacific Islands) and to support vaccine trials in Australia. A further focus of our work is to apply molecular assays to assess the public health impact of malaria in pregnancy. In Colombia, we discovered a very high prevalence of malaria in this population that was grossly underestimated by conventional diagnostics. We are now studying the pathogenesis and dynamics of these infections during pregnancy by analyzing the parasite genotypes and immune status in these women, and evaluating the clinical outcomes in the mother and infant at delivery.
