David Cordray
Professor of Psychology and Human Development, Emeritus
David Cordray's research has focused on estimating the numerical effects of social interventions directed at-risk populations (e.g. homeless, substance abusers). In addition to conducting multi-site evaluations of intervention programs, he has contributed to the development of methodological refinements of quasi-experimental designs, meta-analysis, and non-traditional forms of casual inquiry.
