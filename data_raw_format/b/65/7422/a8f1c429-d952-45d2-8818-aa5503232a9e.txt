His work has been published in high impact peer-reviewed journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, Annals of Neurology, Neurology, Archives of Neurology, Critical Care Medicine, Stroke, and Annals of Emergency Medicine. In addition, he was awarded an NIH KL2 grant in 2012 from the Cornell CTSC and an NIH K23 grant in 2015.
