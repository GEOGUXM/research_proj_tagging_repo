Research Interests
My major research interests lie in cellular and organismal hormetic responses stimulated by dietary intervention. Low levels of stress originating from reduced caloric intake, alterations in amino acid composition and short-term fasting have been previously shown to elicit resistance to larger stresses induced by ischemia, radiation as well as cancer chemotherapeutics. What are not completely understood are the signals, activation cascades and transcription factors needed to elicit the hormetic response. In my research, I study the roles Sirt3 and Nrf2 play in the dietary preconditioning stimulated hormetic response against ischemic reperfusion and ionizing radiation. An ultimate goal would be the development of a dietary regiment that would offer protection to patients and their organs as they undergo chemo- and radio-therapies as well as surgeries where blood flow is restricted for a prolonged period of time.
