Philosophy of Care
In working with patients, I use a careful and efficient application of scientific knowledge to the artful practice of pulmonary medicine. I strongly believe that UC Davis makes a special contribution to the Sacramento-area community through the heartfelt concern of medical students, house staff and faculty for the health and welfare of the patients it serves.
Clinical Interests
Dr. Cross serves as co-director of UC Davis' Adult Cystic Fibrosis Clinic and also has a special interest in alpha-antitrypsin deficiency (congenital emphysema). He has produced over 200 publications on topics related to inhalation toxicology, with a focus on oxidants including ozone, oxides of nitrogen and cigarrette smoke, and antioxidant micronutrients. He also has published on several aspects of clinical lung disease.
