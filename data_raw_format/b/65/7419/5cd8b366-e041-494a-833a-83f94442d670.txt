Overview
I am a nutrition epidemiologist and my research focuses on socioeconomic and contextual correlates of nutrition-related chronic diseases across the life-course. My past and current research pertains to 1) socioeconomic status, obesity, and nutrition transitions in low- and middle-income countries, 2) health disparities in nutrition-related conditions, and 3) early life risk factors for chronic disease. My long-term goal is to effectively bridge nutrition, epidemiology, and public health with econometrics to investigate structural approaches aimed at improving nutrition-related health among vulnerable populations.
