I am interested in understanding the spatial distribution of natural fractures in carbonate depositional systems and the effect of the stratigraphy and lithology on fracture intensity and geometry. I take a process-based approach to understand early fracture development with a focus on carbonate mounds/build-ups. This is accomplished by geomechanical forward models that takes into account variable mechanical properties, differential compaction, and layer-parallel slip to simulate early fracture development processes.
