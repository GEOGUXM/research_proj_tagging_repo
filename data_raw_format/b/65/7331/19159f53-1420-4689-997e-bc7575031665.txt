Biography
Claudia has been a Nurse-midwife since 1988. Her first job was in a private nurse-midwifery practice in Orem, Utah.  After working there for 7 years, she joined the faculty practice here at the University of Utah in 1995. Currently, she is seeing women for outpatient care at both the Madsen and Daybreak University clinics. She is also still delivering babies at the University of Utah. Her focus of care is to encourage and enable women to take charge of their healthcare, with preventative, wholistic care being the method. She provides prenatal, postpartum, labor and delivery care for her pregnant clients, and also gyn care which includes-annual exams, birth control management, school, pre-mission, and pre-marital exams, and care during the peri menopause and beyond. She is also involved in the clinical education of our Nurse-midwifery and Women's Health Nurse Practitioner students here at the College of Nursing. She is the co-instructor of the Simulation learning in clinical practice course for these students as well. Recently, she has been a trainer with the group PRONTO international, travelling to both Kenya and India to train nurses and physicians on low cost, high fidelity Simulation training, to help reduce maternal and neonatal mortality in these countries.
