While all three types of research projects must be taught in every section of the course, different instructors approach the assignment in a variety of ways. We want to spotlight some of these teachers and the original approaches they have to their courses and the compelling work they and their students do. Jill Fennell is a PhD student in the Department of English. She has worked closely with McClung Museum to develop and teach archival research, and her 102 course    Inquiry into the South    and students were recently mentioned in the museum   s February newsletter. They had visited to learn more about the museum   s collections and how to do archival research, one of the types of research and projects all English 102 students must complete. The Composition Office recently talked with Ms. Fennell to find out more about her course and the incredible work she does teaching students to move beyond the classroom and to access academic resources and spaces to create projects with real-world impact. Our interview follows     Why did you propose a course centered on this theme? I choose the theme    Inquiry into the South    because I knew students could use it to explore a number of different, more specified topics. I also think that it is a great topic for teaching research methods and research writing in the humanities. I always start the semester by asking the students to define the humanities, and to think about how one    does    humanities research. Having a topic of inquiry such as    the South    allows the students many avenues to do research that align with the goals of humanities studies. What led you to create digital humanities assignments, particularly for the archival research unit?   I started this assignment as a traditional paper, and then I realized that the actual execution of the assignment could reach a better fruition in a digital format because of more possibilities of artifact representation and a more public audience. Changing the assignment to a digital humanities project helps to give the experience an immediacy and makes the process of writing a paper for a composition class less simulated. By asking my students to conceptualize their historical research as digital and public, it helps with discussions of the    so what    question because students can imagine real people visiting their sites, and they actually want those visitors to understand something new and special that their collection shows. And, yes, I do think that making the archival assignment a digital humanities project makes it a bit harder because I am asking the students to do something new and to think about argumentation and representation in new ways. However, I also think our students are really smart, and the more we respect their intelligence and challenge their creativity, the better we work together to produce good work. How has using the McClung Museum s archives made a difference in your class or allowed you and your students to do something that you wouldn t have been able to do with other archives   Working with McClung Museum has made a huge difference. The staff is great! Going to the museum allows students to see what professional exhibits look like, and ask questions about the process and decisions that make up a finished exhibit. I started thinking about going to the museum the summer after I first taught the assignment. I wanted to find a way to get students to see that the work I was asking them to do was real research that real people could appreciate. In this project, I put a lot of emphasis on their    collection    as opposed to the three artifacts because I want the students to practice the synthesis of putting these objects in relation to one another to create unique meaning. What else would you like people to know about your course?     As much as possible, I try to make my course (and the digital humanities project) reflect the goals of the composition program and my personal teaching philosophy. In class, I try to emphasize transfer as much as possible. I think the digital project, specifically, helps with this because when they learn WordPress, they are learning a platform that 25% of the world   s websites run on. The foundation of my teaching philosophy boils down to trying to get the students to identify with our academic space, to identify as academics, and to think of academic research and writing as something they    do.    This is why working with the archives on campus is so important to me, and why I am so grateful to the museum and the library   s special collections for pulling objects for my students. I want them to feel like they are a part of our community. I don   t want each project to just be something for a grade in a required class, but something they want to show their friends and family. Ms. Fennell also wanted to recognize Assistant Professor and Digital Humanities Librarian Ashley Maynor.   The work Ms. Maynor has done to facilitate digital humanities work on campus has helped instructors and students create projects like the ones Ms. Fennell   s students do. The Digital Humanities Research Guide Ms. Maynor created is a terrific resource. You can find Ms. Fennell   s archival assignment and some of her students    work on her WordPress site.","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/spotlight-on-first-year-composition-jill-fennells-english-102-class-visits-mcclung-museum\/"},{"title":"Winners of the 2017 Creative Writing Awards Announced","content":"Winners of the 2017 Creative Writing Awards Announced The Department of English is pleased to announce the winners of the 2017 Creative Writing Awards.

Learn more about our First-Year Composition program and the Writing Center in our video,  the Writing Program at the University of Tennessee. First-Year Composition, a two-semester sequence of courses, is required of all UT students. In order to be useful to students of all majors and interests, these courses strive to provide tools for critical thinking, reading, and writing that are applicable to courses beyond the first year. First-Year Composition addresses the many different ways we use language, including the new  languages  that comprise our multimedia forms of communication. Its aim is to prepare students to communicate and create new knowledge in the many different communities   academic, business, personal, and international   in which they will live and work. First-Year Composition largely explores rhetoric  how we use language as a social tool to communicate effectively and responsibly with diverse audiences. A primary goal of English 101 and 102 is to teach students to recognize and accept responsibility for the effects their words have on others, a particularly important skill to have as people increasingly  talk  through electronic media and not face-to-face. Students will learn how communication takes place within rhetorical situations and how it is shaped by the purpose, audience, and context in which the communication occurs. Focus is also placed on how these factors shape the inquiry of a topic, the development of research questions, and the development of well-constructed arguments. The primary goal of First-Year Composition is not to create a body of knowledge, but to develop and refine a process of thinking with language. Because we engage in communication daily, studying our language not only helps students succeed in college and in their careers, but also it can help students become better informed, more active members of our society and our world.  rightcolumn   highlight  Contact Jeffrey Ringer 311 McClung Tower University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 Phone  (865) 974-5401 e-mail  jeff.ringer@utk.edu   highlight    rightcolumn ","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/first-year-composition\/"},{"title":"Faculty &#038; Staff","content":"Faculty & Staff  accordion   toggle title= All Faculty & Staff    utpeople    toggle   toggle title= Professorial Faculty    utpeople group= professorial-faculty     toggle   toggle title= Faculty    utpeople group= faculty     toggle   toggle title= Graduate Students    utpeople group= graduate-students     toggle   toggle title= Emeriti    utpeople group= emeriti     toggle   toggle title= Administrative Staff    utpeople group= administrative-staff     toggle    accordion  ","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/faculty-staff\/"},{"title":"MA in English","content":"MA in English Tennessee   s MA program is offered in two concentrations  Literature, Criticism, and Textual Studies and Rhetoric, Writing, and Linguistics.

Urmila Seshagiri Receives NEH Enduring Questions Grant   Urmila Seshagiri was awarded an Enduring Questions Grant by the National Endowment for the Humanities. These grants support faculty members in the preparation of new courses on fundamental concerns of human life as addressed by the humanities. In the words of the NEH, they    encourage undergraduates and teachers to join together in a deep and sustained program of reading in order to encounter influential ideas, works, and thinkers over the centuries.    Urmila   s proposed course was entitled    What Is Duty?    The course Urmila proposed was on the topic    What Is Duty?    In her words,   This course explores the intricate, often tangled paths of duty set forth by Eastern and Western philosophies, religions, and literatures. Focusing on ancient, classical, and modern texts (e.g., the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Sophocles   s Antigone, Mary Shelley   s Frankenstein, Rob Reiner   s A Few Good Men), students will investigate how duty     an obligation based on moral belief     determines the motives and consequences of our actions. The goals for the course are to understand conceptions of duty across multiple contexts, and, in the process, to debate the value of duty as a force in our lives.

Recent Faculty Publications   highlight  Imagining Methodism in Eighteenth-Century Britain  Enthusiasm, Belief, and the Borders of the Self By Misty G. Anderson (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2012) In the Eighteenth Century, British Methodism was an object of both derision and desire. Many popular Eighteenth-Century works ridiculed Methodists, yet often the very same plays, novels, and prints that cast Methodists as primitive, irrational, or deluded also betrayed a thinly cloaked fascination with the experiences of divine presence attributed to the new evangelical movement. Anderson argues that writers, actors, and artists used Methodism as a concept to interrogate the boundaries of the self and the fluid relationships between religion and literature, between reason and enthusiasm, and between theater and belief. Imagining Methodism situates works by Henry Fielding, John Cleland, Samuel Foote, William Hogarth, Horace Walpole, Tobias Smollett, and others alongside the contributions of John Wesley, Charles Wesley, and George Whitefield in order to understand how Methodism s brand of  experimental religion  was both born of the modern world and perceived as a threat to it. Anderson s analysis of reactions to Methodism exposes a complicated interlocking picture of the religious and the secular   terms less transparent than they seem in current critical usage. Her argument is not about the lives of Eighteenth-Century Methodists  rather, it is about Methodism as it was imagined in the work of Eighteenth-Century British writers and artists, where it served as a sign of sexual, cognitive, and social danger. By situating satiric images of Methodists in their popular contexts, she recaptures a vigorous cultural debate over the domains of religion and literature in the modern British imagination. Rich in cultural and literary analysis, Anderson s argument will be of interest to students and scholars of the Eighteenth Century, religious studies, theater, and the history of gender. Reviews   Imagining Methodism in Eighteenth-Century Britain is well researched and will make a significant contribution to our understanding of Methodism, and to the tensions between reason and religion, in eighteenth-century studies.    Laura Rosenthal, University of Maryland  Redefining the relationship among word, flesh, and spirit in the Enlightenment by demonstrating Methodism s expressive urgency in a variety of putatively secular entertainments   drama, music, and erotic fiction   Misty Anderson s book must be read by anyone who wants to keep up with the best work in the field of eighteenth century studies.    Joseph Roach, Yale University   highlight  highlight  The Passion of Perpetua and Felicity (Oxford UP, 2012) By Thomas J. Heffernan One of the most widely read and studied texts composed in Late Antiquity is the prison diary of Vibia Perpetua, a young woman of the elite classes who was martyred in March 202 or 203 C.E. in Carthage, as part of a civic celebration honoring Caesar Geta. She was well-married and had recently become the mother of a baby son, but despite her advantages, she refused to recant her faith when she was arrested with other recent converts to Christianity. Imprisoned with her was her pregnant slave Felicity. Perpetua s steadfastness in her belief led to her martyrdom in the amphitheater. A description of the heroic deaths of both women, and the autobiography of one of the leaders of the Christian community, Saturus, is woven into Perpetua s diary by an anonymous editor, who tells us that, as they died, Perpetua, Felicity, and the other condemned Christians bid farewell with a kiss of peace. This unique and precious text survives in one Greek and in nine Latin manuscript versions. Heffernan s new study contains much that has never been done before, including a prosopography of all the individuals mentioned in the Passion, a new English translation, and the first detailed historical commentary in English on the entire narrative of the Passion. It also includes a newly edited version of the Latin text based on all the extant manuscripts and   rarer still   the Greek text. He concludes the book with a complete codicological description of all of the known manuscripts and thorough scholarly indices of the text itself. Perpetua s prison diary is a revered text of early Christianity, and Heffernan s new translation and commentary brings unprecedented scholarly resources to the much-loved Passion. Reviews      Heffernan s comprehensive and critical treatment of the Passion of Perpetua and Felicity offers specialists and other students of early Christianity the most thorough exposition to date of the Passion s textual, rhetorical, textual, and interpretive complexity. We all owe Thomas Heffernan a debt for lending his scholarly precision and intellectual generosity to this task. Heffernan s text, translation, and commentary will most certainly be the standard edition of this text on which scholars and students will rely in future generations.   ?   Elizabeth Castelli, professor and chair of the Department of Religion, Barnard College    This edition, translation, and comprehensive commentary will remain the definitive resource for scholars who study this influential text. Furthermore, Heffernan s elegant translation perfectly captures the voice of this early Christian woman, whose diary has captivated readers for almost 2000 years.    ?   Joyce E. Salisbury, author of Perpetua s Passion  Death and Memory of a Young Roman Woman.    At last here is a detailed edition and commentary that provides a close and much-needed analysis of the ancient texts in which this remarkable narrative is preserved. Heffernan s careful discussion of the historical context of Perpetua s martyrology shows how a woman of Perpetua s social class was able to write such a vivid account of her own experiences  it also explains how and why her story was preserved, and became an inspiration to Christians throughout the ancient world.    ?

Adams, Michael L. Keene and Jennifer C. Koella From 1880 to 1920, the first truly national visual culture developed in the United States as a result of the completion of the Pacific Railroad. Women, especially young and beautiful ones, found new lives shaped by their participation in that visual culture. This rapidly evolving age left behind the    cult of domesticity    that reigned in the Nineteenth Century to give rise to new    types    of women based on a single feature   a type of hair, skin, dress, or prop   including the Gibson Girl, the sob sister, the stunt girl, the hoochy-coochy dancer, and the bearded lady. Exploring both high and low culture, from the circus and film, to newspapers and magazines, this work examines depictions of women at the dawn of  mass media   depictions that would remain influential throughout the Twentieth Century.   highlight  highlight  The Life of George Eliot  A Critical Biography (Wiley-Blackwell Press, 2012) By Nancy Henry The life story of the Victorian novelist George Eliot is as dramatic and complex as her best plots. Henry   s new assessment of her life and work combines recent biographical research with penetrating literary criticism, resulting in revealing new interpretations of her literary work. A fresh look at George Eliot s captivating life story includes original new analysis of her writing, employs the latest biographical research, and combines literary criticism with biographical narrative to offer a rounded perspective. Reviews     Henry provides a useful reminder that that old-fashioned pejorative, adulteress, might have been applied to Eliot as well as to Agnes, and she provides a sensitive analysis of the novels in the light of that insight.    The New Yorker, 6 August 2012.    Driven neither by hero-worship nor spite, Henry s  critical biography  demonstrates what treasure there is still to be found in even the most worked-over subjects. The trick is to ask the questions that everyone else assumed had been answered years ago.    The Guardian, 2 June 2012.    Such insights fill this book, which shows penetrating intelligence from first to last. Nancy Henry has managed, seamlessly but always with needed distinctions, to unite, in exacting interrelation and with edges sharp, George Eliot   s lived experience and imaginative experience.    George Eliot-G.H. Lewes Studies, 1 September 2012.    Nancy Henry   s new biography of George Eliot is truly a new biography of George Eliot. Henry writes with all thirty-seven of her predecessors in mind as she carefully selects the material that needs repeating, discarding, or modifying. Her massive bibliography results from her thorough research, something difficult to achieve with a figure like George Eliot about whom so much is written, but for which she has gained a reputation as a most conscientious   I would say the most conscientious--of George Eliot scholars.

Each year we admit roughly ten students with funding to our PhD program, eleven students with funding to our MA program, and five students with funding to our MFA program. Students with funding receive a tuition waiver (including summer courses), a teaching assistantship or associateship that pays a graduate stipend, and health insurance.   Potential students who do not wish to be considered for funding (for instance, international students whose tuition will be paid by an external source and who do not intend to teach) should indicate so clearly on their applications. If I am admitted but placed on the waiting list for funding, may I enroll? In the PhD and MFA programs, funding and admission are inseparable  students who are placed on the waiting list for funding will not receive an offer of admission until funding becomes available for them.   We strongly discourage MA students who have applied for funding from enrolling in the program without it, even if they have received an offer of admission.   One recommended option for students in this position is to enroll as a non-degree student and to apply again the following year.   Potential students who do not wish to be considered for funding, who intend either to pay their own tuition or to have it paid by an external source, should indicate so clearly on their applications. How should I prepare in order to be considered for admission? Applicants to the MA and MFA programs must have completed a minimum of 18 credit hours in upper-level English courses to be considered for admission, though an undergraduate major in English (30 credit hours of upper-level English courses or more) is preferred. Although the Graduate School requires that domestic applicants have a minimum 2.7 cumulative GPA and that   international applicants have a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA in all previous undergraduate coursework   for admission to an master s program, prospective MA and MFA candidates should usually have better than a  3.5 average in English courses. Applicants to the PhD program must have been awarded an MA or, in the case of applicants to the PhD with Creative Dissertation, an MFA by the time they begin their study. We do not consider applicants who hold only a bachelor s degree and who wish to be directly admitted into a PhD program without first completing an MA or MFA.   Although the Graduate School requires that domestic applicants have a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA and that international applicants have a minimum 3.3 cumulative GPA in all graduate-level coursework for admission to a PhD program, prospective PhD candidates should usually have a 3.5 average GPA or better in graduate coursework. I am an international applicant.   Where can I find information specific to my situation? Please see the Graduate School s Admission Guide for International Students. How are the applications evaluated? Three admissions committees   one each for the MA , the MFA, and  the PhD   read and rank all applications. Candidates at the top of the ranked list are made an offer of admission with funding  candidates below these top rankings who are nevertheless judged worthy of admission are placed on a waiting list for funding. All  admissions committees pay particular attention to five parts of the application  the statement of purpose, writing sample(s), GRE scores, letters of recommendations, and undergraduate and or graduate transcripts. How do the committees evaluate GRE scores? We are particularly interested in the Verbal portion of the General test. In recent years, most successful applicants both for the MA and the PhD have had a verbal score of at least 160 (600 on the old test) or above. If you take the GRE more than once, the committees generally consider the highest score rather than the most recent. However, Graduate Admissions will always look at the most recent. What is the University of Tennessee   s code for GRE scores? 1843. Where can I find information about the GRE? Visit the GRE home page at www.gre.org. Whom should I ask to write my letters of recommendation? It is best to have the rating forms completed by professors or instructors who have had you in their courses. They can more accurately evaluate your performance in the classroom than can a supervisor or coworker at your place of employment, an athletic coach, or a clergy member. The admissions committee wants to read evaluations of your ability to complete graduate work in English successfully. An English professor is the best judge of that ability. Can I reapply if my application is rejected? Candidates who are denied entrance into graduate degree programs may reapply for admission if their application has been substantially enhanced. Please see or call the Director of Graduate Studies for suggestions. Any candidate who is denied admission to a graduate program twice will not be considered a third time.","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/graduatestudies\/admissions-information\/"},{"title":"Graduate Students of English","content":"Graduate Students of English The Graduate Students of English (GSE) is an organization open to all enrolled members of the graduate program in the English Department of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.

With a distinguished faculty of thirteen scholars, the division provides training in the many fields and sub-fields that characterize modern and contemporary literature and culture. Courses in modernism and modernist literature examine the unprecedented experimentation that characterized poetry, fiction, and drama in the century   s early decades, and the changing relationships between literary production and the material cultures of modernity. Courses in contemporary literature explore postmodernism and such emerging forms as the graphic novel, language poetry, performance art, and emerging forms of digital culture. In the area of British, Irish, and Anglophone literatures, the division provides opportunities to study such canonical writers as James Joyce and Virginia Woolf while also offering courses in South Asian, Caribbean, and other postcolonial literatures. In the area of American literature, the division provides opportunities to study Southern, African-American, Asian-American, and Native American literatures, as well as more canonical literary figures and movements. The division   s numerous offerings in major literary genres are complemented by the department   s extensive graduate courses in critical theory and its courses in film study, which explore the intersections of cinema, literature, and culture. Research assistantships allow graduate students working on twentieth-century literature to work closely with individual faculty members on research and editorial projects, while reading groups, specialized exams, and visiting scholars speaking on twentieth-century literature and culture help students professionalize themselves in specialized areas of scholarship.","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/20th-and-21st-century-literature\/"},{"title":"Theory","content":"Theory As a brief look at the English department   s curriculum will confirm, our discipline is inspired by a host of different concerns, and employs a wide variety of scholarly methodologies. Critical theory is a conversation about and across these disciplinary differences, a conversation that graduate students are encouraged to join, regardless of their areas of specialization. Faculty in critical theory teach and research in a variety of fields. Some study literature for the insight it provides into the great cultural transformations of the past millennium  some focus on human psychology and the questions of identity in their historical particularity and their more enduring forms  others look to the ethical and political questions of identity, communication, and nation that face us today. We have faculty members working in the theoretical areas of narrative, psychoanalysis, performance, rhetoric, critical race, and feminist and gender studies, as well as many other fields. The graduate curriculum in critical theory consists of three types of courses. The first includes surveys of criticism that put key critical ideas in historical perspective. The second is genre courses focusing on poetics and narrative theory  like the surveys, these have a broad historical scope. Finally, seminars and readings courses on specific topics such as Modernism, drama and performance, literature and the new digital technologies, and the sublime, provide various and exciting offerings from year to year. The department has an active Critical Theory Reading Group that includes both faculty and graduate students. It meets weekly to explore new work in literary theory, as well as pertinent scholarship in adjacent disciplines. It also gives graduate students the chance to interact with faculty from a variety different fields and other departments. Faculty in critical theory regularly organize lectures by visiting scholars, symposia, and conferences on topics of current interest. The bi-annual graduate student conference, NEXUS, is an outgrowth of these conversations. Graduate students in critical theory have won a number of prestigious awards including scholarships to the School of Criticism at Cornell University.","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/literature-criticism-and-textual-studies\/theory\/"},{"title":"Rhetoric, Writing and Linguistics","content":"Rhetoric, Writing and Linguistics The English Department at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, offers a BA, MA, and PhD in English with a Concentration in Rhetoric, Writing, and Linguistics (RWL). A dynamic and interdisciplinary course of study, RWL is part of the UT   s tradition of excellence in rhetoric and composition. Undergraduate Studies in RWL With its broad focus on the study of discourse, the RWL program offers undergraduate students the opportunity to apply the critical skills they learn as English majors to a wide range of academic, professional, and public settings. Through courses in rhetorical theory and criticism, argumentation, public, technical, legal, and online writing, linguistics, and language education, students explore how rhetorical actions develop within communities, cultures, workplaces, and classrooms  develop a critical consciousness of their own language use  and learn to communicate with diverse audiences in multiple contexts. In short, our students learn both how language works and how to use it. The RWL faculty is committed to undergraduate education and helping students achieve both academic and professional success. Our graduates have gone on to careers in college and university teaching, law, medicine, professional writing, business, library science, political consulting, public relations, advertising, publishing, editing, consulting, grant writing, labor organizing, and non-profit management. If you are considering concentrating in RWL, we encourage you to contact us to discuss your academic and professional goals. Graduate Studies in RWL At both the MA and PhD levels, the concentration in RWL is designed to foster innovative and imaginative as well as rigorous scholarship and teaching. To that end, the core curriculum invites students to work across a broad range of RWL areas, including the history of rhetoric, theories of rhetoric and writing, critical theory, composition research and pedagogy, literacy studies, technical communication, applied linguistics, and second-language acquisition. RWL students are also encouraged to explore multidisciplinary perspectives. Through coursework and directed research, students can make connections with other areas in English studies, including literary periods and genres, ethnic and national literatures (especially African American, American, and British literatures), feminist criticism, and literary theory. Further, RWL students can pursue cross-disciplinary interests that carry them into fields such as education, legal studies, political science, drama and performance studies, philosophy, history, and sociology. The Interdisciplinary Program in Linguistics has been directed by our faculty members, and graduate students may also draw on the resources of Marco Institute of Medieval and Renaissance   Studies. Beyond the classroom, RWL students at UT participate in a lively and supportive intellectual community. Along with coursework, RWL reading groups, guest speakers, and social events provide students and faculty with regular opportunities for formal and informal exchange. Faculty and students also work together through department-sponsored research assistantships and collaborative research projects. Applied Linguistics and ESL The strengths of linguistics in the Department of English lie in the areas of language and law, ESL, and sociolinguistics. Recent dissertations in linguistics ESL in the English department have included qualitative research studies of second language graduate students  initiation into disciplinary cultures and historical text analyses of methods and repercussions of teaching English to Native Americans from the mid 1800s to the end of the 20th century. Master s theses have looked at issues such as writing center tutor response to ESL students. Job possibilities abroad and in higher education continue to be strong for graduates, particularly those with expertise in rhetoric and ESL. For more information, contact Tanita Saenkhum (tsaenkhum@utk.edu) Within the RWL Concentration, graduate students have a range of professional opportunities in both teaching and research. All MA candidates, including those concentrating in RWL, receive pedagogical training and acquire teaching experience over the course the two-year Masters program. As first-year students, MAs work closely with experienced writing teachers and serve as participant observers in one first-year writing class. New MAs also work as tutors in the Writing Center, and they take English 505, the course that prepares students to serve as Graduate Teaching Assistants and to teach their own sections of First-Year Writing the following year. Doctoral candidates teach primarily in the First-Year Writing Program where they serve as Graduate Teaching Associates, teaching one or two courses per semester. All graduate students are invited to participate as presenters in the annual Fall Teaching Workshops (held the week before classes begin) and in the Stokely Conference on Teaching Writing, a workshop held at UT each summer for area K-12 writing teachers.

Before declaring an English major, all students must first satisfy the prerequisite of the major by completing English 101 and 102 or their equivalents, and taking two 200-level English electives. After satisfying the prerequisite, majors   in consultation with a departmental academic advisor   take ten courses numbered 300 and above, distributed to ensure both breadth and depth of study. An English major can choose among four concentrations, but all four of the concentrations share a core of five courses with the following distribution  One must be pre-1660 literature One must be of literature written from 1660-1900 One must be post-1900 literature One must be in language, theory, folklore, cultural, ethnic, gender, or film studies One must be a special topics, major authors, or senior seminar A list of approved courses for each distribution can be found in the English Major Booklet.   The remaining five courses will be used to complete the concentration requirements. Students may select from the following concentrations  Creative Writing  Aims to help the student develop his or her artistic voice through the writing of poetry, fiction, and drama. Literature  Involves study and analysis of novels, poems, plays, and non-fictional prose in English. Rhetoric and Writing  Uses both writing workshops and theoretical approaches to help the student develop a mastery of self-expression and argument. Technical Communication  Prepares the student to write for business, industry, and science. The specific distribution requirements for each concentration are detailed in the menus for that concentration. In addition to the four concentrations, a major may choose an individualized program.  For students who wish to pursue studies or projects not adequately treated in existing courses, the department offers an opportunity to participate in independent study with a faculty member. In addition to approving such courses of study, the director of undergraduate studies is also empowered to approve individualized concentrations developed by students in consultation with their advisors. These programs should be designed to achieve academically sound objectives that are not addressed by the course requirements for established concentrations. Courses may NOT count toward more than one category. Depending on the course content, special topics, major authors, senior seminar, junior   senior honors seminar, and any other course with variable content may be petitioned to count in a category where it is not listed. Students may count the two 200-level English courses required for prerequisites to the English major toward their College of Arts and Sciences Humanities Distribution Requirements. The courses may also apply to the UT General Education requirement if they display a    WC and or    AH    at the end of the course description. If a student uses an upper-level course to satisfy a major requirement, he or she  may not  use it to satisfy an upper-level distribution requirement. Likewise, if an English course is used to satisfy the upper-level distribution, it may not be used to satisfy a major requirement.   toggle   toggle title= English Major Advising   The faculty takes advising seriously because it wants students to make informed choices about their curricula and career goals. Each major is assigned a faculty advisor to consult with each semester. The electronic English Major Newsletter provides weekly information from the undergraduate office concerning advising and other matters of interest for subscribers. In order to get the most benefit from advising sessions, students are strongly urged to prepare by reviewing their progress in meeting college and major requirements. During the meeting, advisor and advisee discuss courses, requirements, the design of the major curriculum, and post-graduation plans. For each English major, the departmental office keeps a file that may be consulted by students or their advisors any time during working hours. Students are responsible for contacting their advisors to make an advising appointment. Office hours are the best time for contacting an advisor. Before each advising session, stop by Room 311, McClung Tower, to pick up an advising folder and prepare the following  (1) a DARS report  (2) a list of the courses you hope to take the following semester  and (3) specific questions concerning requirements or anything else. Students are also encouraged to talk with their advisors about career goals. The English department is committed to making a student s experience as an English major both personalized and rewarding. Students should not hesitate to contact their advisors for additional help.   toggle   toggle title= Declaring English as a Minor   An English minor consists of at least 15 credit hours of English courses at the 300 and 400 level.

While our department does not offer a degree in teaching ESL, we do offer several courses to help prepare students interested in this field, which also fulfill some degree requirements in the College of Education s program in Foreign Language or ESL teacher training. Most of these 400-level courses are offered on a two-year rotation. For more information, view our  Undergraduate Course Descriptions. English Department Courses  English 474  Teaching English as a Second Language I Introduces issues in teaching ESL such as the political dimensions of the enterprise  theory and research into how adults learn second languages  the effect of variable attributes of learners (for example, age, motivation, individual cognitive style) on language learning  and varieties of methodologies in teaching ESL. It assumes no background in ESL, but does assume experience with language learning. English 476  Second Language Acquisition Explores, in detail, research on and theories of how languages are learned, beginning with infants learning their first languages, and moving to adults learning second languages. English 477  Pedagogical Grammar for ESL Teachers Focuses on features of the structure of English that create problems for English learners. It is intended to help (prospective and current) ESL teachers understand English structure well enough to be able to answer learners  questions with accuracy and confidence. English 575  Issues in L2 Rhetoric and Composition Examines rhetorical, political, linguistic, and pedagogical issues in teaching writing at English language institutes or at the college or university level (particularly freshman composition) to learners whose first or strongest language is not English.

Students learn to express themselves more effectively and discover the power language has to organize and develop thought. Students practice writing traditional essays, poetry, fiction, screenplays, or the writing and editing of technical reports. Thus, student writers gain important cognitive skills while enhancing their personal, academic, and professional development.

Students develop skills in reading complex works from a variety of perspectives, and they deepen their understanding of the relation between literature and the historical and cultural forces that constitute it. By exposing students to a range of historical periods, authors, and genres, courses in literature expose students to a rich field of canonical and non-canonical texts. These courses also sharpen students  abilities to analyze and write about literary works and cultural issues.

The findings from an initial document analysis of students    102 writing suggested they needed more help with how to conduct and write up historical and qualitative research, which we reported to instructors during workshop sessions. Analysis of papers written in the following semester showed noticeable improvements in students    mastery of these types of research in our curriculum (Benson, K.,    On the Verge of Inquiry  A Research Remix for First-Year Composition,    CCCC, Louisville, KY, 2010).

Educating and training our undergraduate students is vital to our mission. Smaller class sizes and one-on-one attention to writing and thinking allows students and instructors to develop close working relationships that can last a lifetime. Through our faculty   s nationally renowned scholars, writers, and teachers, our students experience the latest intellectual, creative, and professional developments in the discipline s many fields.  Once enrolled in the major, English students can choose from four concentrations  Literature, Creative Writing, Rhetoric and Writing, and Technical Communication. The department also supervises an honors concentration that brings together the best students in smaller, challenging classes  a semester-long seminar  and an independent honors theses of their own design.  callout align= left  Special topics courses cover such subjects as the Beat poets, Arthurian legends, feminist theory, Toni Morrison, post-colonial British and Indian literature, and the crime novel.   callout The department also offers off-campus courses in which students study drama in performance in New York and in Stratford and London in the UK. The English major is designed to be both intellectually stimulating and versatile. Our classes train students to write with clarity and sophistication  to analyze and interpret literary and other kinds of texts and place those texts within historical, theoretical, and aesthetic contexts  to evaluate arguments according to their logical and rhetorical features  and to understand, think about, and respond to the values offered in written texts. This training allows English majors to take their places within a rapidly evolving society, a globalized culture, and an increasingly information-based economy. In the spirit of liberal education in the humanities, the study of English also allows our students to respond to society s increasing need for a citizenry skilled in critical thought and communication. As a result of this rich and extensive training, our majors are presented with a range of career options in the areas of finance, law, medicine, business, and more. Some of our alumni pursue teaching careers both here and abroad, and a number of majors apply each year to be admitted into the English Education Licensure program within the College of Education. Some become freelance writers, working for themselves or in the fields of creative writing and journalism.  Others become professional editors and publishers or embark on careers in management, public relations, advertising, sales, administration, library science, or public service. Graduates with a special interest in academic life pursue advanced study in English or related fields. Finally, students who take advantage of the department s strong technical communications course offerings pursue careers in technical writing and editing, website design, and other fields essential to today s rapidly-evolving communication atmosphere.

By taking courses in a variety of literary periods and genres, English majors concentrating in literature gain rich exposure to literary history and to the texts, movements, authors, and cultural forces that constitute it. In addition, students are trained in analysis and interpretation, the uses of literary theory, and the complex organizational and verbal skills involved in critical writing. In fulfilling the requirements of the concentration, students study literary subjects ranging from Chaucer to Toni Morrison  Shakespeare to the Romantic poets  Milton  Donne  and their contemporaries to contemporary drama. Special topics courses are regularly offered in areas such as Lewis Carroll and nonsense literature  Arthurian legends  and race, gender, and cultural studies. The literature concentration offers extensive training in critical thinking, advanced reading and analysis, and oral and written communication. It also addresses questions of artistic production, textuality, culture, values, and communication. For these and other reasons, literature has proved an excellent concentration for students planning careers in law, education, publishing, journal and magazine writing, research, evaluation, advertising, library science, public relations, business, and public service. Concentration Requirements All students concentrating in literature take the Colloquium in Literature (English 376), an introduction to literary studies, close reading, and the theoretical lenses through which literary texts can be viewed (for example, feminist theory, psychoanalytic criticism, new historicism). Students also take literature courses from a range of designated periods as described below. English 376 or 377  (should be taken at the beginning of the major).

Our majors routinely find employment in business and industries such as engineering, healthcare, and software development. Because successful completion of this concentration involves such a deep and varied engagement with the nature of language in relatively formal settings, students pursuing careers in law and education also find this concentration useful. Other students find that the undergraduate study of professional and technical communication leads them to pursue graduate studies in technical communication, rhetoric and composition, literature, communications, or information science. The Department of English works closely with the East Tennessee Chapter of the Society for Technical Communication  (STC-ETC)  to provide students with opportunities to connect with professionals in the field of technical communications. The Society of Technical Communication (STC) has a diverse membership including technical writers, editors, graphic designers, multimedia artists, web designers, translators, printers, publishers, educators, and students in a variety of technological fields. With 15,000 members worldwide, the STC is the largest professional organization serving the scientific and technical communication profession.

Students choose to pursue a PhD in one of three concentrations  Literature, Criticism, and Textual Studies  Rhetoric, Writing, and Linguistics  or Creative Dissertation. We have a world-class research library with special collections in British and American literary and cultural history, excellent financial support, and a nationally and internationally recognized faculty. Our students have many opportunities for collaboration with faculty on scholarly journals, research assistantships, poetry and fiction readings, and reading groups. Generous travel funds for research and presentations at scholarly conferences help our students enter the profession and begin to establish themselves in their respective fields within the discipline. The Graduate Students in English organization, area study groups, and other activities draw students together as an intellectual and social community with shared passions and aspirations. Many of our PhD graduates have been chosen for tenure-track positions at research universities, comprehensive universities, and liberal arts colleges, as well as for other postdoctoral fellowships and appointments. For a list of recent placements, click here.  accordion   toggle title= Entrance Profile of Candidates   The admissions deadline is December 1 for admission to all our doctoral concentrations. All   applicants to the PhD program must hold an MA or MFA degree by the time they begin their coursework in the fall.   We do not admit people directly from the BA program. All admitted applicants begin their coursework together as a class in the fall. While most of our candidates hold master s degrees  in English, we also consider applicants with master s degrees in related  disciplines. Typically, admitted students are able to transfer up to 24 hours of course credit from their MA or MFA degrees. If students arrive with fewer than 24 hours of transferable credit in English, the Director of Graduate Studies may require that they take additional coursework in English. The Graduate School requires a  3.0 GPA average in all previous coursework at the graduate level for admission to PhD programs, but most of our applicants for the PhD have a much higher GPA in their coursework. We evaluate all of our degree candidates holistically, based on a portfolio of grades, recommendations, GRE scores (with an emphasis on the Verbal score), a statement of goals, and a writing sample. We are interested in the overall picture of strengths and interests that these materials provide. We have no specific cutoff numbers for the GRE scores, though our most competitive candidates have Verbal scores of 160 (600 on the old test) or  higher. For information about how to complete your application, click on Admissions.   toggle   toggle title= Teaching   We strive continually for  teaching excellence in the graduate and the undergraduate classroom. Our professorial faculty and our graduate students share in the balance of teaching and research that makes up the academic life. PhD students with funding at UT are considered teaching associates. During their first year in the program, they teach one section of composition in the Fall and one in the Spring. In subsequent years in the program, the teaching load rises to two courses in the Fall and two in the Spring, but this load may be reduced if students win competitive research assistantships and or dissertation-year fellowships. Our graduate student teachers as well as our professorial faculty regularly win departmental, college, and university teaching awards for their superb work in the classroom. Associateships for PhD students include a tuition waiver and health insurance, and current stipend amounts, paid over twelve months, are $16,497 per year for a maximum of five years.

Paul Blakely Awards","content":"J. Paul Blakely Awards The J. Paul Blakely Awards Competition In 1986, the East Tennessee Chapter of the Society for Technical Communication established a competition to recognize excellent students in scientific and technical communication and to honor one of our most distinguished former members  J. Paul Blakely. These awards honor student excellence in technical communications and science journalism.   Awards are given in both undergraduate and graduate divisions in the categories of Technical Communication and Science Journalism. Blakely was an active, well known, and well loved member of STC.   At the society level, he   d been assistant to the president for conferences (1984), manager of the strategic planning committee (1981   84), assistant to the president for recognition programs (1979   82), and technical program manager for the society   s annual conference (1980).   In 1986, shortly before his death, he was made an associate fellow of the society. Blakely   s society-level activity did not steal him away from local service or from excellence in his job, however, as many people here still remember with gratitude and admiration.   He was three times president of the chapter and was a long-time representative of the chapter in planning WATTec, a local technical conference.   As assistant director of the Information Division for Martin Marietta in Oak Ridge, he consistently promoted STC and encouraged potential leaders of the profession and society.   His favorite words of encouragement were    Sure you can!      Under his mentorship, many did. Nor did Blakely   s diagnosis of cancer in the early 80s keep him from personal or professional service.   Notably, he organized and led CancerNET, the only cancer support group of its kind in Tennessee.   Blakely   s wife, Tinque, continued for many years to honor her husband   s memory with service and contributions to the American Cancer Society, and that organization named a room in their Knoxville headquarters the    Tinque Blakely Crusade Conference Room      despite her protests that it should bear her late husband   s name. The night that the first Blakely Award was to be given out   at the 10th annual Practical Conference on Communication (PCOC)   Paul Blakely was very ill and in a hospital receiving treatment for his cancer.   His death, it was to turn out, was just a few weeks away.   Attendees at the awards ceremony had been saying to each other how sad it was that Paul couldn   t be at the banquet to witness presentation of the first Blakely Award.   But during the ceremony, to everyone   s surprise and delight, in walked Paul, who had checked himself out of the hospital so he could attend the ceremony.   Still taped to his hands were hospital I.V. catheters. That kind of behavior was characteristic of Paul Blakely  he refused to let his illness destroy his life while life was still in him.   It   s the reason, his wife said, that he had taken the Mensa membership tests two years before his death.   To his great satisfaction, he had passed the tests and joined the organization. J. Paul Blakely is a superb role model for young men and women in our field  a person of compassion, courage, service, accomplishment, and intellect.   The chapter could not have done better than to name its awards competiton for him.   Every year at the awards ceremony, he is remembered and honored in a short speech.   You, too, are honored tonight   as a winner of this year   s J. Paul Blakely Awards.   Congratulations, and best wishes for continuing academic success, for a distinguished career, and for a life full of achievement, service, and happiness.   Can you have all that?

MFA students are introduced to the rewarding work of classroom instruction through our award-winning writing program, which has been nationally recognized for its excellence in teacher training and professional development. MFA students have the opportunity to teach both First-Year Composition and courses in Creative Writing.   First-year MFA students on teaching assistantships apprentice with a master teacher, assist as tutors in the Writing Center, and study the best practices in writing and critical reading instruction with our rhetoric and composition faculty. The director of First-Year Composition and the director of the Writing Center provide valuable guidance, insight, and support throughout the teaching experience. In their second year, MFA students are appointed as teaching associates and take full responsibility for their own courses. MFA teaching associates can expect to teach two courses per semester, a mixture of First-Year Composition and Creative Writing.

However, this semester we went outside the text. In English 411, my classmates and I took 18thcentury literature and made it apply to today   s world.  Oronooko,  a piece about slavery, translated into an event on human trafficking in Knoxville. Over 300 people attended the event, and as I stood in the back of the packed room and watched, I realized that this was the purpose of college. Not only has the English department given me the best professors from whom I learn about novels and poems, but it has given me the professors from whom I learn about the world and myself.

A dynamic and interdisciplinary course of study, RWL is part of the UT   s tradition of excellence in rhetoric and composition. Undergraduate Studies in RWL With its broad focus on the study of discourse, the RWL program offers undergraduate students the opportunity to apply the critical skills they learn as English majors to a wide range of academic, professional, and public settings. Through courses in rhetorical theory and criticism, argumentation, public, technical, legal, and online writing, linguistics, and language education, students explore how rhetorical actions develop within communities, cultures, workplaces, and classrooms  develop a critical consciousness of their own language use  and learn to communicate with diverse audiences in multiple contexts. In short, our students learn both how language works and how to use it. The RWL faculty is committed to undergraduate education and helping students achieve both academic and professional success. Our graduates have gone on to careers in college and university teaching, law, medicine, professional writing, business, library science, political consulting, public relations, advertising, publishing, editing, consulting, grant writing, labor organizing, and non-profit management. If you are considering concentrating in RWL, we encourage you to contact us to discuss your academic and professional goals. Graduate Studies in RWL At both the MA and PhD levels, the concentration in RWL is designed to foster innovative and imaginative as well as rigorous scholarship and teaching. To that end, the core curriculum invites students to work across a broad range of RWL areas, including the history of rhetoric, theories of rhetoric and writing, critical theory, composition research and pedagogy, literacy studies, technical communication, applied linguistics, and second-language acquisition. RWL students are also encouraged to explore multidisciplinary perspectives. Through coursework and directed research, students can make connections with other areas in English studies, including literary periods and genres, ethnic and national literatures (especially African American, American, and British literatures), feminist criticism, and literary theory. Further, RWL students can pursue cross-disciplinary interests that carry them into fields such as education, legal studies, political science, drama and performance studies, philosophy, history, and sociology. The Interdisciplinary Program in Linguistics has been directed by our faculty members, and graduate students may also draw on the resources of Marco Institute of Medieval and Renaissance Studies. Beyond the classroom, RWL students at UT participate in a lively and supportive intellectual community. Along with coursework, RWL reading groups, guest speakers, and social events provide students and faculty with regular opportunities for formal and informal exchange. Faculty and students also work together through department-sponsored research assistantships and collaborative research projects. Applied Linguistics and ESL The strengths of linguistics in the Department of English lie in the areas of language and law, ESL, and sociolinguistics. Recent dissertations in linguistics ESL in the English department have included qualitative research studies of second language graduate students    initiation into disciplinary cultures and historical text analyses of methods and repercussions of teaching English to Native Americans from the mid 1800s to the end of the 20th century. Master   s theses have looked at issues such as writing center tutor response to ESL students. Job possibilities abroad and in higher education continue to be strong for graduates, particularly those with expertise in rhetoric and ESL. For more information, contact Tanita Saenkhum (tsaenkhum@utk.edu) Within the RWL Concentration, graduate students have a range of professional opportunities in both teaching and research. All MA candidates, including those concentrating in RWL, receive pedagogical training and acquire teaching experience over the course the two-year Masters program. As first-year students, MAs work closely with experienced writing teachers and serve as participant observers in one first-year writing class. New MAs also work as tutors in the Writing Center, and they take English 505, the course that prepares students to serve as Graduate Teaching Assistants and to teach their own sections of First-Year Writing the following year. Doctoral candidates teach primarily in the First-Year Writing Program where they serve as Graduate Teaching Associates, teaching one or two courses per semester. All graduate students are invited to participate as presenters in the annual Fall Teaching Workshops (held the week before classes begin) and in the Stokely Conference on Teaching Writing, a workshop held at UT each summer for area K-12 writing teachers.

University requirements and College of Arts and Sciences requirements are explained in the Undergraduate Catalog  college requirements are further detailed in the Curriculum Guide and Handbook (see Forms and Resources). English department requirements are explained in the English Undergraduate Advising Booklet. Before declaring an English major, all students must first satisfy the prerequisite of the major by completing English 101 and 102 or their equivalents, and taking two 200-level English electives. After satisfying the prerequisite, majors   in consultation with a departmental academic advisor   take ten courses numbered 300 and above, distributed to ensure both breadth and depth of study. An English major can choose among four concentrations, but all four of the concentrations share a core of five courses with the following distribution  One must be pre-1660 literature One must be of literature written from 1660-1900 One must be post-1900 literature One must be in language, theory, folklore, cultural, ethnic, gender, or film studies One must be a special topics, major authors, or senior seminar A list of approved courses for each distribution can be found in the English Undergraduate Advising Booklet.   The remaining five courses will be used to complete the concentration requirements. Students may select from the following concentrations  Creative Writing  Aims to help the student develop his or her artistic voice through the writing of poetry, fiction, and drama. Literature  Involves study and analysis of novels, poems, plays, and non-fictional prose in English. Rhetoric and Writing  Uses both writing workshops and theoretical approaches to help the student develop a mastery of self-expression and argument. Technical Communication  Prepares the student to write for business, industry, and science. The specific distribution requirements for each concentration are detailed in the menus for that concentration. In addition to the four concentrations, a major may choose an individualized program.  For students who wish to pursue studies or projects not adequately treated in existing courses, the department offers an opportunity to participate in independent study with a faculty member. In addition to approving such courses of study, the director of undergraduate studies is also empowered to approve individualized concentrations developed by students in consultation with their advisors. These programs should be designed to achieve academically sound objectives that are not addressed by the course requirements for established concentrations. Courses may NOT count toward more than one category. Depending on the course content, special topics, major authors, senior seminar, junior   senior honors seminar, and any other course with variable content may be petitioned to count in a category where it is not listed. Students may count the two 200-level English courses required for prerequisites to the English major toward their College of Arts and Sciences Humanities Distribution Requirements. The courses may also apply to the UT General Education requirement if they display a    WC and or    AH    at the end of the course description. If a student uses an upper-level course to satisfy a major requirement, he or she  may not  use it to satisfy an upper-level distribution requirement. Likewise, if an English course is used to satisfy the upper-level distribution, it may not be used to satisfy a major requirement.","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/undergraduate-study\/english-major-requirements\/"},{"title":"English Major Advising","content":"English Major Advising The faculty takes advising seriously because it wants students to make informed choices about their curricula and career goals. Each major is assigned a faculty advisor to consult with each semester. The electronic English Major Newsletter provides weekly information from the undergraduate office concerning advising and other matters of interest for subscribers. In order to get the most benefit from advising sessions, students are strongly urged to prepare by reviewing their progress in meeting college and major requirements. During the meeting, advisor and advisee discuss courses, requirements, the design of the major curriculum, and post-graduation plans. For each English major, the departmental office keeps a file that may be consulted by students or their advisors any time during working hours. Students are responsible for contacting their advisors to make an advising appointment. Office hours are the best time for contacting an advisor. Before each advising session, stop by Room 311, McClung Tower, to pick up an advising folder and prepare the following  (1) a DARS report  (2) a list of the courses you hope to take the following semester  and (3) specific questions concerning requirements or anything else. Students are also encouraged to talk with their advisors about career goals. The English department is committed to making a student   s experience as an English major both personalized and rewarding. Students should not hesitate to contact their advisors for additional help.","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/undergraduate-study\/english-major-advising\/"},{"title":"Declaring English as a Minor","content":"Declaring English as a Minor An English minor consists of at least 15 credit hours of English courses at the 300 and 400 level.

A Critical Biography The life story of the Victorian novelist George Eliot is as dramatic and complex as her best plots. Henry   s new assessment of her life and work combines recent biographical research with penetrating literary criticism, resulting in revealing new interpretations of her literary work. A fresh look at George Eliot s captivating life storyIncludes original new analysis of her writingDeploys the latest biographical researchCombines literary criticism with biographical narrative to offer a rounded perspective. Reviews     Henry provides a useful reminder that that old-fashioned pejorative, adulteress, might have been applied to Eliot as well as to Agnes, and she provides a sensitive analysis of the novels in the light of that insight.    (The New Yorker, 6 August 2012)    Driven neither by hero-worship or spite, Henry s  critical biography  demonstrates what treasure there is still to be found in even the most worked-over subjects. The trick is to ask the questions that everyone else assumed had been answered years ago.    (The Guardian, 2 June 2012)    Such insights fill this book, which shows penetrating intelligence from first to last. Nancy Henry has managed, seamlessly but always with needed distinctions, to unite, in exacting interrelation and with edges sharp, George Eliot   s lived experience and imaginative experience.    (George Eliot-G.H. Lewes Studies, 1 September 2012)    Nancy Henry   s new biography of George Eliot is truly a new biography of George Eliot. Henry writes with all thirty-seven of her predecessors in mind as she carefully selects the material that needs repeating, discarding, or modifying. Her massive bibliography results from her thorough research, something difficult to achieve with a figure like George Eliot about whom so much is written, but for which she has gained a reputation as a most conscientious   I would say the most conscientious--of George Eliot scholars.

Many popular eighteenth-century works ridiculed Methodists, yet often the very same plays, novels, and prints that cast Methodists as primitive, irrational, or deluded also betrayed a thinly cloaked fascination with the experiences of divine presence attributed to the new evangelical movement. Misty G. Anderson argues that writers, actors, and artists used Methodism as a concept to interrogate the boundaries of the self and the fluid relationships between religion and literature, between reason and enthusiasm, and between theater and belief. Imagining Methodism situates works by Henry Fielding, John Cleland, Samuel Foote, William Hogarth, Horace Walpole, Tobias Smollett, and others alongside the contributions of John Wesley, Charles Wesley, and George Whitefield in order to understand how Methodism s brand of  experimental religion  was both born of the modern world and perceived as a threat to it. Anderson s analysis of reactions to Methodism exposes a complicated interlocking picture of the religious and the secular, terms less transparent than they seem in current critical usage. Her argument is not about the lives of eighteenth-century Methodists  rather, it is about Methodism as it was imagined in the work of eighteenth-century British writers and artists, where it served as a sign of sexual, cognitive, and social danger. By situating satiric images of Methodists in their popular contexts, she recaptures a vigorous cultural debate over the domains of religion and literature in the modern British imagination. Rich in cultural and literary analysis, Anderson s argument will be of interest to students and scholars of the eighteenth century, religious studies, theater, and the history of gender. Reviews   Imagining Methodism in Eighteenth-Century Britain is well researched and will make a significant contribution to our understanding of Methodism, and to the tensions between reason and religion, in eighteenth-century studies.    Laura Rosenthal, University of Maryland  Redefining the relationship among word, flesh, and spirit in the Enlightenment by demonstrating Methodism s expressive urgency in a variety of putatively secular entertainments   drama, music, and erotic fiction   Misty Anderson s book must be read by anyone who wants to keep up with the best work in the field of eighteenth century studies.

The book seeks to understand how the eighteenth-century scientific idea that race was transformable influenced early American literature. As fantastical as it seems today, many Americans during the 1700s believed that race was an external bodily condition that was produced incrementally and could change over time. Focusing on writers such as Benjamin Franklin, Phillis Wheatley, and J. Hector St. John de Cr  vecoeur, my project explores how authors used figurative language emphasizing or questioning the potential malleability of physical features to describe a person   s race. This study examines how writers drew upon these ideas about race so that we can better understand how science and literature interact in the construction of racial categories.Transformable Race and the Literatures of Early Americawill tell the story of how early American authors imagined, contributed to, and challenged the ways that one   s racial identity could be formed in the time of the nation   s founding. Congratulations to Katy, who was among the 85 recipients selected from over 1,000 applicants for the award.

In summer 2010, the University of Tennessee Libraries acquired more than 300 early printed books from the collection of the late Naseeb Shaheen, noted Shakespeare scholar and professor of English at the University of Memphis for forty years. The centerpiece of the Shaheen Antiquarian Bible Collection is a group of about 100 English Bibles dating from the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, when the Christian scriptures were first translated into the vernacular languages of Europe. These early printed Bibles, along with psalters, prayer books, homilies, and major European literary works, form the core of the collection used by Dr. Naseeb Shaheen in his seminal studies of biblical references in Shakespeare s plays. Among the most exciting resources for literary scholars are early editions of major works by Shakespeare s contemporaries, from Edmund Spenser s 1596 Faerie Queene to the plays of Ben Jonson, Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, Philip Massinger, and John Dryden, as well as editions and translations of Shakespeare s literary sources, such as Plutarch s Lives, Ovid s Metamorphoses, and Cinthio s Hecatommithi. The collection also houses important 16th-century historical works, from Polydore Vergil s  Anglica Historia to Raphael Holinshed s Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Shaheen was an internationally known authority on Shakespeare s use of the Bible. His definitive studies of biblical allusions in the plays, collected in his almost 900-page Biblical References in Shakespeare s Plays, compares apparent biblical references against all literary sources and versions of Scripture that would have been known to the Bard. His collection of pre-King James Bibles was one of the largest in the world. The Shaheen Antiquarian Bible Collection includes more than 60 examples of the Geneva Bible, the Scripture most often referenced in Shakespeare, as well as early printings of the so-called Great Bible, Bishops  Bible, Matthew s Bible, the Douay-Rheims Version, and the King James Bible.

On one hand, the southern economy was invested in laissez-faire, liberal capitalism that emphasized individual opportunism, modernization, and participation in global commerce. On the other, the predominance of slavery and the social structures that sustained the individual plantations created a culture that was isolated, rural, and socially oppressive.

Coleman   s book highlights the intersection of two cultural trajectories in America around 1850, both often downplayed in literary histories  a boom in preaching, associated with the growth of evangelicalism and the country   s oratorical traditions, and the long struggle of the novel, still facing considerable disdain at mid-century, to achieve moral legitimacy and aesthetic autonomy. Before the Civil War, the preacher in the pulpit was the culture   s paradigmatic voice of moral authority, and novelists who wished to establish the moral value of their own storytelling needed to incorporate sermons. This book explores how antebellum ministers sought to preach effective, authoritative sermons and how novelists sought to claim a similar authority through canny representations of preachers, often veiled critiques of actual ministers, and sermonic voice, or a creative reworking of the sound of preaching. Such intense engagement with sermons shaped some of the period   s most interesting and important novels, including  The Scarlet Letter, The Quaker City, Moby-Dick, Uncle Tom   s Cabin,  and  Clotel. In illuminating how novelists sought to displace traditional religious institutions,  Preaching and the Rise of the American Novel  reminds readers of the deep connections between Americans    religious practices and their literature and speaks to how the processes of secularization are often less concerned with rejecting the elements of religion than reimagining them.    Dawn Coleman addresses a historical blind spot in U.S. literary history. She points out that historians of U.S. culture have generally failed to take religion, religious literature, and the production and consumption of religious texts into serious consideration   applying the same level of theoretical and practical sophistication they bring to the study of secular literature. Coleman asserts that such study is itself serious enough to qualify as a cultural phenomenon requiring explanation.  Preaching and the Rise of the American Novel  is an ambitious, intriguing, and persuasive attempt to build a bridge spanning that longstanding divide.       Ezra Greenspan, Edmund J. and Louise W. Kahn Chair in Humanities, Southern Methodist University    Dawn Coleman   s book is thoroughly researched, well written, and clearly argued. It will contribute to recent discussions about the dynamic relationship between religious expression and fiction by providing a literary application of David Hall   s valuable discussions of    lived religion    to the nineteenth-century American novel.

In many ways, he attests, the national representation of the South was controlled more firmly by periodical editors working in the Northeast, such as William Dean Howells, Thomas Bailey Aldrich, and Richard Watson Gilder, than by writers living in and writing about the region. Fears about national unity, immigration, industrialization, and racial dynamics in the South could be explored through the safe and displaced realm of a regional literature that was often seen as mere entertainment or as a picturesque depiction of quaint rural life. The author examines in depth the short work of George Washington Cable, Charles Chesnutt, Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Lafcadio Hearn, Mary Noailles Murfree, and Thomas Nelson Page in the context of the larger periodical investment in the South. Arguing that this local-color fiction calls into question some of the lines of demarcation within U.S. and southern literary and cultural studies, especially those offered by identity-based models, Hardwig returns these writers to the dynamic cultural exchanges within local-color fiction from which they initially emerged. Review Hardwig   s argument stands in productive tension with recent work on regionalism, but it also contributes to new millennium scholarship on multiculturalism and transnationalism. Upon Provincialism succeeds admirably in changing the way we understand nineteenth-century U.S. literature.

Graywolf will publish the book in early 2015.  The Graywolf Press Nonfiction Prize is designed to honor and encourage the art of literary nonfiction, and is given to an outstanding manuscript by an emerging author who has published no more than two previous books of nonfiction.    It   s a marvel to see Margaret Lazarus Dean chart that greatest of American obsessions, the dream of manned spaceflight, from the    flashbulb memory    of the  Challenger  disaster to the waning days of the last shuttle launches,    said Graywolf Press associate editor Steve Woodward.    Once a place where Mailer and Wolfe and others staked their claim, the subject has become, in Margaret Dean   s hands, an incisive look at how our forays into space, then and now, have served to reflect our national imagination.  Leaving Orbit  transmutes awe into understanding on this farewell tour of NASA   s shuttle program even as it looks toward what comes beyond the end of the future.    Robert Polito, outgoing Director of the Graduate Writing Program at the New School in New York and soon-to-be president of the Poetry Foundation in Chicago has high praise for  Leaving Orbit      Something analogous to Bob Dylan   s temporal and spatial freewheelin    propels Margaret Lazarus Dean   s smart, spirited, and elegiac new book, as she tracks the trajectory of the final three manned space shuttle orbiters of the 21st  century. For  his spaceflight story,  Mailer proved skeptical, if ultimately exuberant, whereas Dean emerges as a poet of a belated, cooler, perhaps more clear-eyed and rueful tone     Sometimes it seems as though Norman Mailer   s generation got to see the beginnings of things and mine has gotten the ends.              Graywolf was my dream publisher for this project right from the start,    said Margaret Lazarus Dean,    and I feel insanely lucky that Robert Polito and the Graywolf editors felt the same way. Graywolf is known for creative nonfiction that doesn   t shy away from complexity, that is smart and fresh, and that pushes the boundaries of the genre. To be included on this list of prizewinners like Ander Monson, Kevin Young, and Eula Biss is a fantasy come true.    Professor Dean is also the author of  The Time It Takes to Fall  (Simon & Schuster, 2007), a novel about the space shuttle  Challenger  disaster.   Her work has appeared in  StoryQuarterly,  FiveChapters,  Michigan Quarterly Review, and the  Huffington Post, and she is a recipient of an NEA fellowship and a Hopwood Award for the novel.","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/margaret-lazarus-dean-wins-graywolf-press-nonfiction-prize\/"},{"title":"Master of Fine Arts Degree Approved","content":"Master of Fine Arts Degree Approved During their July 2013 meeting, the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC) gave their approval to the Department of English offering a Master in Fine Arts (MFA) degree.   This degree will replace our current Masters in English with a concentration in Creative Writing degree.   The Creative Writing Program will begin accepting applications for the new MFA program this fall, with our first class of MFA students beginning in 2014. The MFA degree in Creative Writing will promote a combination studio academic course of study.   Degree candidates will hone their skills as writers and grow as artists through rigorous application of craft, under the tutelage of our distinguished faculty of Creative Writing and our impressive series of visiting writers. Students will receive critical feedback on their poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction in writing workshops, scrutinize aspects of genre in special topics classes and investigate larger theoretical and historical contexts for creative work in literature, rhetoric, writing, and linguistics courses. They will have the opportunity to gain editorial experience by working with Grist  The Journal for Writers, our graduate student edited journal with a national reputation for publishing strong new work from established and emerging writers.   They will also have the opportunity to participate in cultural outreach programs such as the Brian M. Conley Young Writers    Institute.   The MFA program culminates in a creative thesis comprised of a book-length manuscript of original creative work. Excellent financial support, including generous travel funds for research and presentations at scholarly conferences, help our students enter the profession and begin to establish themselves in their respective fields within the discipline. The Graduate Students in English organization, area study groups, and other activities draw students together as an intellectual and social community with shared passions and aspirations. While the MFA is an essential credential for those students who plan to teach creative writing at any level and those who wish to pursue a PhD in English with a concentration in Creative Writing, the faculty of the Creative Writing Program at the University of Tennessee believes that study and practice of literary arts is intrinsically valuable and our program is designed first and foremost for those students who wish to dedicate their lives to writing well.

The book includes a poem about buying an expensive cooked chicken that is actually about,  Love of good food and love of poetry that turns the bad stuff into the  gold  of art.

Professor Matsuda, a professor of English and Director of Second Language Writing at Arizona State University and the  President-Elect of the American Association for Applied Linguistics,  will speak on the topic   Voice in Written Discourse  Voice in writing has long been a controversial topic. While  it is considered to capture a sense of identity that is often  tied to    good writing,    the concept has been notoriously  difficult to define, analyze, or teach. Some scholars have also  problematized its association with Western individualism,  while others have questioned its relevance to academic  writing. To address these questions, Professor Matsuda will first present  a definition of voice that accounts for various conceptions  of this complex notion. He will then present three studies of  voice in written discourse   personal as well as academic   to  show that the notion of voice can be useful in understanding  the construction and negotiation of identity in personal and  academic written discourse.

For more than a hundred years now, the bachelor   s degree in the U.S. has been a combination of three elements  the major, General Education requirements, and electives.   This compromise, unique internationally, is under pressure from multiple directions.   Surprisingly, it is the major that is in the most trouble, and    Gen Ed    that seems most poised to take advantage of recent developments.   But there are problems with the contemporary framing of    Gen Ed.      Using histories of both rhetoric and composition, this talk suggests a way forward for the American baccalaureate. David Fleming is professor of English at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.   He has published articles and chapters on the history of rhetoric, argumentation theory and practice, writing in the disciplines and professions, and the history and pedagogy of freshman composition.   He is the author of City of Rhetoric  Revitalizing the Public Sphere in Metropolitan America (SUNY P, 2008) and   From Form to Meaning  Freshman Composition and the Long Sixties, 1957-1974, (U of Pittsburgh P, 2011), which   won the 2011 MLA Mina P.

Professor Nussbaum will have a student discussion on Tuesday, 9 17, at 10am, in the Black Cultural Center. Since the events of 9 11, the Muslim community has been stigmatized for the horrific events of that day. Today there are approximately 2.7 million Muslims in the United States. The American Muslim population is expected to increase in the next two decades. Many of these families have been here for generations, and they are the pillars of their communities. Thinking individuals know we cannot blame a community for the actions of a minority. Yet, it is often difficult to see one s way to such truth. Martha Nussbaum provides a rational and morally appropriate prescription to allay the anxieties and prejudices against the Muslim population during this tumultuous decade. Professor Nussbaum advocates    equal respect for human dignity,       principled consistency and self-examination,    and an    active, curious imagination    which is accepting of different religious perspectives. Her talk will provide an ethical roadmap for understanding and confronting the roots of such hatred. Nussbaum holds appointments in the University of Chicago Law School and Department of Philosophy, as well as associate appointments in the Divinity School, and the departments of Classics and Political Science. Her interests include ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, political philosophy, feminism and ethics, including animal rights. She previously taught at Oxford, Brown and Harvard Universities. Having served on the Council of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Council of Learned Societies, Professor Nussbaum is presently a member of the Committee on Southern Asian Studies and a board member of the Human Rights Program. She is the recipient of honorary doctorates conferred by over 40 national and international universities. Dr. Nussbaum is the author of, among many other publications, Political Emotions  Why Love Matters for Justice (to be published in 2013), The New Religious Intolerance  Overcoming the Politics of Fear in an Anxious Age (2012), Creating Capabilities  The Human Development Approach (2011).

The Scholar of the Week Award is featured on UTK s main webpage and says the following about Dr. Hardwig  Bill Hardwig, associate professor and director of undergraduate studies in the English Department, specializes in Southern and Appalachian literature. His book  Upon Provincialism  Southern Literature and National Periodical Culture, 1870-1900  was recently published by the University of Virginia Press. Drawing on tourist literature, travelogues, and local-color fiction about the South,  Upon Provincialism  tracks the ways in which the nation   s leading interdisciplinary periodicals, especially the  Atlantic Monthly,  Harper   s, and the  Century, translated and broadcast the predominant narratives about the late-nineteenth-century South. The book argues that fears about national unity, immigration, industrialization, and racial dynamics in the South could be explored through the safe and displaced realm of a regional literature that was often seen as mere entertainment or as picturesque depiction of quaint rural life. Harilaos Stecopoulos, author of  Reconstructing the World  Southern Fictions and U.S. Imperialisms, 1898   1976, writes,    Hardwig   s argument stands in productive tension with recent work on regionalism, but it also contributes to new millennium scholarship on multiculturalism and transnationalism.Upon Provincialism  succeeds admirably in changing the way we understand nineteenth-century U.S. literature.

A man with a silver-handled cane and old-fashioned sideburns was standing next to him on the bridge. Contemplating his life and what it is worth. It is through self-evaluation and personal validation that he came to find himself chanting,    Pugna Vestri Everto,    or    Fight off your demons.    Dreams of Le Conte buffeting winds like sandpaper upon virgin skin. He didn   t want to be there, but there   s no escape. The peaks reached into the ionosphere, he could feel himself battered by radio waves. The radio waves changed to radioactive particles. The particles dispersed in the air and settled in the pores of all who stood there. The Earth began to shake beneath their feet, sending them crashing to the ground. And then the monsters came   gnashing their teeth in hunger and fury. The gnashing rose in timbre and Helen rose from the ash heaps by the road   rose from the primordial decay of past death and hints of future death   and slew them with her screams. They echoed out over the hills outside her townhouse and were silently buried underneath the snow. But not before they screamed in anguish, calling out for help to no one.    Give no chance to a man or irrelevance. For he is irrelevant,    Cecil said.    Huh?! Whatever!       No, seriously   the easiest way to sleep at night is to call on believing that I do not exist #YOLO!    Which is defined as,    You only lack originality.       I don   t lack originality, I   ve got it coming out of my      ying yang.    The panda I adopted last summer   I was forced to leave him in a small bamboo thicket north of Shanghai, but I can   t forget him. But I digress. I was hearing the voices and screaming again, and it was driving me mad. And then he turns and quotes Rhett Butler, saying,    Frankly, my dear, I don   t give a damn.    She had never seen the film and was frankly astonished by his use of language. Growing up in a southern port city, she had heard all the curse words under the sun and not hearing one every other word was strange. So to create a balance to the stark difference, she muttered one simple word under her breath     shit.    Then she ran. Then she tripped. Her body hit the hard ground as her balance failed underneath her. She slid for a few feet and came to an abrupt stop in a puddle. Covered in mud from head to toe, she began crying her eyes out. Her ankle hurt and she was sure it was broken. She wondered why she got hurt before the World Cup. So she went to the doctor to have her ankle examined. And was left in the waiting room for 3 hours. The room was so cold, that frost webs crawled over the tiles and her breath froze in her nostrils. As her breath also began to freeze in her throat, she struggled for breath, and slowly began blacking out   but just as she saw the walls closing down on her, squeezing out light and life, she remembered the insulated cup of hot Starbucks coffee in her backpack  she reached for her bag, now desperate for the salvific hot liquid   . Unfortunately, all the coffee had spilled out of the cup in her backpack, ruining her school things and leaving her desperate. This was but the first in a long line of first-world tragedies that would afflict her over the course of the school day. This semester had been just as bad. For example, every class with a Jim had been in a gym, and with a Paul was appalling, and all the cute people of a certain gender had been eaten by aliens. But we learned to love those who were    ugly    and we began the war against the aliens. The President saw it on the news and looked down solemnly.    It   s spooky outside,    she whispered.    But isn   t it spooky to hide in here?    I asked. She glared at me, and then laughed. We kissed instead. However, we were interrupted by the Cthulu sashaying through the window. We called for help, but no one came   we were left to defend ourselves. Using only the supplies we had on hand, we fashioned weapons to fight our enemy. The blacksmith proved to be most useful, despite the others    doubts. Have faith in specialists  they are titled that for a reason. She smiled, swallowing the desire to laugh at the idea that she seek the council of authority figures. I loved and lost, but my love for you will never die. It was cold. But their emotions were keeping them warm from the ice-cold blizzard in Antarctica where they hid from ice dragons. They emerged as beautiful unicorns adorned with all of the Peruvian gold they could carry. And then one of them fell off their horse and when he hit the ground his hair turned a majestic color of purple. The purple hue of his hair acted as a beacon for the townspeople of Magesmania, who rose up and charged into the battle of their fathers. The townspeople of Magesmania fought with all their might and sadly lost the 12-year war against their fathers. Although they lost the 12-year war against their fathers, they still had faith to fight for the upcoming year when they would be able to grow stronger with more recruits. It was going to be a long winter. However, why not? It is what is needed   a time of rest, a time to lie down, and time to just be. Without the incubation process, I   d never be able to move forward. But move forward I finally did, without even a backward glance. Today is the day I   ll make my change. As the cold winter wind blows upon my face, I feel the change is for the better. The days of autumn and my former self came to pass. Winter is here and I   m ready for spring.

And breaking through the ice of the pond she fell   and Helen   oh Helen of ashes, rise!   and the water swallowed her body and her breath was crushed beneath the interminable weight of freezing darkness  but there was a glimmer on the surface. That glimmer held her there, suspended in the water, her mind frozen   no other thoughts, just the feeling of that glimmer pulling. Taking into a state of pure subconscious, completely bare and numb. The bear huddled deeper into his cave, trying to find what little warmth he could. A deer and a rabbit then entered the cave and helped the bear build a fire. To warm their fur coats from falling into the cold pond, they also grabbed their earmuffs and killed all of the city   s local kitties. Then they turned the kitty fur into more earmuffs and sold them to raise money for the local animal shelter. PETA was still pissed, however, due to the mass genocide of lovable household pets.    I don   t approve of genocide,    said John. He looked outside and wished people were nicer to animals   and other people   as a few men ran down the street in the pouring rain  it was a miserable day. He stopped in front of a sandwich shop, next to a man smoking under an over-sized umbrella. He asked if he could have a cig and asked his name.    My name is Gertrude,    she replied,    and I only smoke cigars.       Well, then,    he said with a noxious smirk,    you must try one of my Montecristos.    And once I remembered a girl named Shelley who muttered and mumbled strangely rapid phrases.

Henry writes with all thirty-seven of her predecessors in mind as she carefully selects the material that needs repeating, discarding, or modifying.

I applied for the internship through UT   s Congressional Internship program, which I highly recommend for anyone with an interest in government, public policy, or legislation. As an intern, I answered phone calls from constituents, gave tours of the Capitol building, attended events with Senators and their staff members, compiled daily press clippings for the Senator, attended committee hearings, transcribed speeches, and wrote memos. At first, I was extremely nervous to go to D.C.   After just three days on Capitol Hill, however, my anxiety dissipated and I began to really enjoy my experience. For the first six weeks of my internship, I lived one block from the Dirksen Senate building where I would be working on the Hill. Living on the Hill was such a unique experience for me   I could see the Supreme Court and the Capitol building from my window and I lived within walking distance of all the major museums and attractions. The last four weeks of my internship, I lived in an apartment in the Foggy Bottom district of D.C. next to George Washington University and close to Georgetown. Those last four weeks were my favorite in D.C.  I was familiar with the city, comfortable in my position at work, and living just two blocks from the Lincoln Memorial! Along with gaining valuable work experience during my internship, I also formed important relationships with staff members and was able to interact with members of Congress on a regular basis. I rode the elevator with Senator John McCain, played softball on the National Mall with Senator Alexander and Senator Bob Corker, and ate lunch in the Senate Dining Room beside Senator Rand Paul. My experience in D.C. has been extremely valuable to me both personally and professionally, and I really hope that I get to work on Capitol Hill again one day.   highlight ","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/in-our-own-words\/"},{"title":"&#034;In My Own Words: Rome Edition&#034; by Katherine Frazier","content":" In My Own Words  Rome Edition  by Katherine Frazier In her blog entry,  In My Own Words  Rome Edition,  Katherine Frazier writes about her experiences living and studying abroad in Rome. To study abroad or not study abroad, that was the question.   However, for me personally, it was never a question.   Ever since I was in high school, I knew that studying abroad was something I had to do while I was in college.   I dreamt of studying in Europe, having the best time of my life, traveling, writing, taking pictures, and experiencing a different culture.   And to be sitting here now, writing about my experience and knowing that I lived in Rome for 4 months is just surreal.   Once I made the decision to study abroad, the next step was choosing where to go.   Well, with basically everywhere being an option, I knew that decision would be hard.   However, I always had this longing to go to Italy.   The culture and the people have always interested me because it is so different from the American culture, so I knew I would learn so much.   Rome was my final decision.   I did not know anyone else going, which made it that much more exciting and also intimidating.   People would always tell me what not to do and to be careful when I told them where I was going, which made me a little nervous  however, the whole semester before I left, I was so ready to go.   I could not wait to see what was waiting for me in Rome.   I knew that I was embarking on the adventure of a lifetime  and that is exactly what it was.  rightcolumn    rightcolumn    The people that I met were just the greatest.   I cannot get over how awesome it was making friends from all over the country.   Plus making friends while you are studying abroad means you are travel buddies, which is another bonus.   The things that I got to see while I lived in Rome were just incredible.   I still cannot believe I was there while the whole world watched the Catholic Church announce a new Pope.   My friends and I would just talk about how unbelievable our timing was being in Rome during this amazing event.   And being there in the Vatican City when Pope Francis was announced as the new Pope of the Catholic Church was just a once in a lifetime experience that I will never forget.   The culture, the food, the people, and everything about Italy is just amazing.   Every city I visited in that country was different, and yet the same.   The people are warm and friendly and man, do they know how to cook.   Every place that I got to travel to outside of Rome was like a dream, full of history, culture, and beauty.   Not only did I enjoy the beauty of the country, but I also learned so much.   This experience stretched me in so many ways, teaching me about myself and about the world where I live.   I think studying abroad is the best thing you can do while you are in college and I want to encourage everyone I know that has the opportunity to take it.   It   s hard, yes, but I promise you it   s so worth it in the end.   I will carry the memories and the stories from this experience with me my entire life, every day wishing to go back to my little home in Rome.

As I flipped between the social networking tabs on my laptop--avoiding even a moment   s glance at my Western Civilization courses   I stumbled upon a Haiku contest hosted by one of the Twitter handles I follow, USA TODAY Opinion (@USATOpinion).   USA TODAY   s editorial section was hosting a contest entitled    Haiku Your View,    and the basic rules of entry were simple  1. Entries must be a true haiku with 5 syllables on the 1st line, 7 syllables on the 2nd line, and 5 syllables on the 3rd line, 2. Entries must be sent in using the hashtag #usatodayhaiku, 3. Entries must comment on a recent international or national news event.   The contest guidelines were easy enough, so I read on to find out that the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners all would be published in an edition of the USA TODAY along with being mentioned on the Twitter and Facebook pages of USA TODAY Opinion  and as an added bonus the 1st place winner would receive a Kindle Fire HD valued at $269.00.   The mentions alone were enough to persuade me to enter, so I looked for the entry deadline and found that the contest would end in 30 minutes. I quickly scribbled down some words on my notepad and checked to make sure what I wrote down met the guidelines of a true haiku and then I sent a tweet to @USATOpinion with the required hashtag.   The finished product was a simple haiku that was really just a summation of my thoughts on an underlying issue that was intertwined in many of the major international and national news stories of 2013  More school tragedies, Teachers are undervalued, Future in their hands. Each entry was judged by the USA TODAY judges on the following criteria  25% creativity and originality of haiku, 25% content writing of haiku, 25% relevance to recent news event contest theme, and 25% on clarity of opinion.   I was selected by the USA TODAY judges to be in the Top 10 out of hundreds of entries.   Then a few days later my haiku was selected by popular vote of the readers and I claimed the #1 spot.   The subject of my simple haiku was a reflection of my choice to study to become an English educator but the combination of these 60+ characters was a deeper reflection.   Our professors, teachers, and adjuncts   no matter what title they hold   are all educators and they are usually the most undervalued resources of the institution to which they belong.   Much of the    education reform    that is taking place today seems to be against both the educators and the students working only in the favor of government.   The tragedies that occur in our schools are not just limited to the ones that are destructive and physical  educational tragedies occur daily in our classrooms limiting the individual creative potential of our students.

George Copway (1818-1869), a.k.a. Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh, was an Ojibwe writer and speaker during one of history s most challenging periods for North American Indians  the removal era. Born in a wigwam in present-day Ontario, Copway wrote three books, published an Indian newspaper in New York City, and became Canada s first literary celebrity in the United States. In 1850 he took a six-month tour of Europe and subsequently produced the first Indian-authored, full-length travel book   Running Sketches of Men and Places...  (1851), a book that despite its apparent notability has never received sustained scholarly treatment. Lyons  presentation will discuss Copway s fascinating book in the context of nineteenth-century removal politics, international cosmopolitanism, and an evolving modernity, both his and ours, that Copway sought to embrace, but which ironically made him an ambiguous figure -- ambiguous, that is, to us, Scott Richard Lyons is Associate Professor of English and American Culture at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The author of  X-Marks  Native Signatures of Assent  (University of Minnesota Press, 2010) and numerous essays on Native American literature, culture, and rhetoric, Lyons is currently working on two book projects concerning modernity and the transnational dimensions of Native American literature and culture.

I probably don   t have to say the statement that provokes this question, as it is one that every English major I know has been asked.  Teaching is what   s expected of most humanities majors, and it   s highly respectable, though not everyone (myself included) can teach. I   ve had the same major since I was a freshman, but the past three years have been as much of an exploration career-wise as if I had come in undecided. Not having the constriction of a straight-to-job path like pre-med or engineering, I had the freedom and time to discover my passion, while English gave me the critical thinking and writing skills to succeed in a variety of fields. I   ve had the fantastic opportunity to work at The Daily Beacon as the Arts & Culture Editor, and this year, as Editor-in-Chief. I   ve interned at a non-profit in Nashville and a software company near Oak Ridge. Last spring, I worked with Attack Monkey Productions, the music management company that puts together the annual Rhythm    N Blooms Festival downtown. That experience led me to accept an internship with Big Picture Media in New York City over the summer. BPM is a music publicity company that works with media outlets to promote their large roster of indie rock alternative clientele. Moving to New York was probably the most adventurous thing I   ve ever done -- the city is huge, and about as different from Knoxville as you can get (strangers don   t smile when you make eye contact there). My job was mainly research and compiling press reports for the bands, but it was real work with a real purpose in the company, which gave me a great perspective on what working in PR in the music industry is like. While working the press tent at the Village Voice   s annual 4Knots Festival, I got to meet many young journalists working at music magazines I love, like Rolling Stone and Stereogum. Being in the city was just as much of an education as the internship itself. The huge array of museums, parks, and history combined with the independence of living on my own helped me figure out who I want to be after graduation, and how I can get there. Though I haven   t decided yet if I want to work on the PR or journalism sides of entertainment media, I now know that both are options I would be happy with and have valuable experience in. With the excellent teaching and education I   ve received in both Knoxville and New York, I   m excited to see where the next opportunity will take me.

Chiles s  Transformable Race  Surprising Metamorphoses in the Literature of Early America was published by Oxford  University Press in January 2014.  rightcolumn   rightcolumn  As surprising as it might seem now, during the late eighteenth century many early Americans asked themselves,  How could a person of one race come to be another?  Racial thought at the close of the eighteenth century differed radically from that of the nineteenth century, when the concept of race as a fixed biological category would emerge. Instead, many early Americans thought that race was an exterior bodily trait, incrementally produced by environmental factors and continuously subject to change. While historians have documented aspects of eighteenth-century racial thought, Transformable Race is the first scholarly book that identifies how this thinking informs the figurative language in the literature of this crucial period. It argues that the notion of transformable race structured how early American texts portrayed the formation of racial identities. Examining figures such as Phillis Wheatley, Benjamin Franklin, Samson Occom, and Charles Brockden Brown, Transformable Race demonstrates how these authors used language emphasizing or questioning the potential malleability of physical features to explore the construction of racial categories. Review     Transformable Race adds measurably and convincingly to our understanding of the early American understanding of race. Katy L. Chiles shows how early American literature was a venue for many subtle and incisive explorations of racial mutability. Configuring a diverse archive   featuring especially Occom and Wheatley, Franklin and Aupaumut, Crevecoeur, Marrant, Brown, Equiano, Brackenridge, and Tyler   early American literature emerges here as a richly experimental space where the concept of racial mutability was examined, dramatized, questioned, criticized, and itself transformed.

Prelli on    Mapping Perspectives in Ecological Thought and Discourse  The Case of Plant Ecology During the Early Twentieth Century    from 3 30 until 5 00pm, in 1210 McClung Tower.  rightcolumn   rightcolumn  Public understandings of ecology associate the term with a natural science that largely speaks univocally about environmental issues. Prelli   s study shows in contrast that ecology is best characterized by important turns and transitions among a plurality of ecological perspectives. Boundaries among those perspectives are mapped according to the    master tropes    that prefigured them, using the ideas of Kenneth Burke and Hayden White for analytical guidance.   There is no single plant ecology during the early decades of the twentieth century, but a plurality of plant ecologies distinguishable by the tropes they respectively featured. Concepts and facts adduced by leading plant ecologists were imaginatively constituted by featured tropes as much as they were proven through logic and by empirical evidenceProfessor Prelli   s talk will discuss the implications of using the tropes to map terminological boundaries among perspectives participating in ecological discourse in comparison with the alternative of Kenneth Burke   s dramatistic pentad. Lawrence J. Prelli is a professor of Communication and affiliate professor of English and of Natural Resources at the University of New Hampshire in Durham.

These highly competitive Fellowships (only about 7% of applicants receive funding) provide    support    for    individuals pursuing advanced research that is of value to humanities scholars, general audiences, or both    (NEH). Dr Henry   s Fellowship will support the completion of her book project Women and the Nineteenth-Century Cultures of Investment. In the abstract for the project, Henry writes that this book defines the cultures that emerged in response to the democratization of the stock market in nineteenth-century Britain when investing provided legal access to financial independence. Women voted in shareholder meetings, as they could not in political elections, and their experiences as investors complicate notions of separate domestic and public spheres. In fact, women writers often invested income from their writing, becoming contributors to national and global economies. In fiction, Victorian novels represent those economic networks in realistic detail and are preoccupied with the intertwined economic and affective lives of characters. Analyzing evidence about real investors together with a wide range of fictional examples, I argue that investing was not just something women did in Victorian Britain  it was a distinctly modern way of thinking about independence, risk, global communities and the future in general. (19c Seminar) Professor Henry   s research and teaching interests are in Victorian literature with special emphases on nineteenth-century cultures of finance, colonialism and imperialism. She also has interests in textual criticism, biography and the life and writings of George Eliot.

About the seminar, Professor Wogan-Browne  explains, As multilingual paradigms take effect in re-shaping literary and socio-linguistic histories of English, current re-thinking of the vectors of English-language literary vernacularity in medieval England continues apace with, for instance, Christopher Cannon   s recent      From Literacy to Literature  Elementary Learning and the Middle English Poet,    PMLA 129.3 (2014)  349-64.     This seminar takes up an older study from 2003 in which the historian Jeremy Catto raises the question of whether we can think in terms of literature or perhaps even of literary culture for vernacular writing in England before the late fourteenth century.   I think this an informed and very well argued article, though one with many of whose premises and conclusions I disagree  it seems to me to raise issues of interest both for medievalists and for scholars and students in post-medieval fields as to what we can agree to call literature and why and how it matters. For the seminar, Professor Wogan-Browne has provided some reading materials that can be obtained by emailing Dr. Laura Howes. Please note, however, that it s not necessary for you to read the essays in order to attend the seminar. Please direct any questions about her visit to Dr. Laura Howes (lhowes@utk.edu) or Dr. Mary Dzon (mdzon@utk.edu).","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/wogan-browne\/"},{"title":"Novelist Jonathan Miles To Read at Writers in the Library","content":"Novelist Jonathan Miles To Read at Writers in the Library Novelist and  New York Times  Columnist Jonathan Miles at UT s  Writers in the Library  January 26 Novelist Jonathan Miles will read from his recent work at the University of Tennessee s Writers in the Library on Monday, January 26, at 7 p.m. in the Lindsay Young Auditorium of the John C.

Editors Allen Dunn and Thomas F. Haddox have gathered contributions from leading scholars that challenge the dominance of contemporary historicism. These pieces critique historicism as it is generally practiced, propose alternative historicist models that transcend mere formula, and suggest alternatives to historicism altogether.

Papke","content":"Twisted From the Ordinary, Edited by Mary E. Papke Twisted from the Ordinary  Essays on American Literary Naturalism, edited by Mary E. Papke, was published by the University of Tennessee Press in 2003.  American literary naturalism both seduces and repulses the reader, disrupting stable notions of individual and moral coherence.  rightcolumn    rightcolumn Usually associated with works such as Frank Norris   s McTeague and Stephen Crane   s    The Open Boat,    naturalism draws on nineteenth-century theories of hereditary and environmental determinism, emphasizing the role of chance in characters    struggles for survival in an increasingly industrial, capitalistic, urban jungle. The essays in this volume revise the canon of naturalism, looking beyond the classic period of the 1890s to uncover naturalistic tendencies already at work in such mid-nineteenth-century authors as Rebecca Harding Davis and Elizabeth Stuart Phelps and to elucidate the naturalistic themes exploited more recently by postmodern authors such as Raymond Carver and Don DeLillo. While canonical figures   Norris, Crane, Jack London, Theodore Dreiser, and Edith Wharton   are represented, the approaches to these authors    works are innovative, appealing to concepts as diverse as Foucault   s clinical gaze, the perversion of the gift economy, the rapacious competition implicit in the acquisition of cultural capital, the erasure of racial difference from the urban landscape, and the moral critique of individual freedom. Other essays deal with writers not primarily identified with naturalism, including Henry James, whose treatment of human agency is also central to early modernism, and Jane Addams, whose explicit moralism lays bare naturalism   s often hidden reform agenda. A stimulating, unique collection, Twisted from the Ordinary tests the generic boundaries of American literary naturalism and shows its ongoing relevance in understanding a broad set of themes, ranging from Victorian sentimentalism and the overdetermination of violence in true-crime novels to the ethical implications of recent scientific research and the social forces shaping selfhood in the twenty-first century.

Hailed as the most important book yet from the author of the international bestseller  The Shock Doctrine,This Changes Everything presents a case for  why the climate crisis challenges us to abandon the core    free market    ideology of our time, restructure the global economy, and remake our political systems. Klein argues that nations worldwide need to  embrace radical changes in carbon emissions standards or radical changes will be visited upon our physical world. Four UTK faculty members will comment upon the book and its claims  Amy J. Elias, Professor of English  R. Scott Frey, Professor of Sociology  Gary McCracken, Professor of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology  and John Nolt, Professor of Philosophy. The discussion will be held in 1210 McClung Tower at 4 pm. In  This Changes Everything,    Klein argues that climate change is an alarm that calls us to fix an economic system that is already failing us in many ways. She builds a case for how massively reducing our greenhouse emissions is our best chance to simultaneously reduce gaping inequalities, re-imagine our broken democracies, and rebuild our gutted local economies.  Klein argues that the changes to our relationship with nature and one another that are required to respond to the climate crisis humanely should not be viewed as grim penance, but rather as a kind of gift   a catalyst to transform broken economic and cultural priorities and to heal long-festering historical wounds. And she documents the inspiring movements that have already begun this process  communities that are not just refusing to be sites of further fossil fuel extraction but are building the next, regeneration-based economies right  now.

Over half of the plays of the English Renaissance were written collaboratively   by multiple dramatists working together.  Joint Enterprises  examines this kind of dramatic production, charting its social and professional significance as a historically embedded but personally inflected creative phenomenon. By situating individual joint works such as  Eastward Hoe, The Two Noble Kinsmen, and  The Changeling  in specific institutional contexts, Heather Hirschfeld explores the diverse motivations driving dramatic collaborations, traces the distinct writerly relationships that developed from such energies, and analyzes their rhetorical effects in individual plays. Drawing on a range of documentary and literary sources as well as recent methodological advances in theater history, the book presents a sequence of case studies designed to accommodate both the larger cultural setting of the early modern theater and the localized, idiosyncratic factors influencing discrete literary productions. Each chapter chronicles the professional setting of a particular joint work and then investigates its rhetorical or linguistic traces in the resultant text. This approach allows Hirschfeld to locate specific links between modes of collaborative production and forms of dramatic representation and then explicate the literary and political implications of these connections. Hirschfeld s case studies provide a fresh account of the institutionalization   the steady growth, organization, and incorporation   of the professional drama in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English cultural life. By attending to the changing shapes and stakes of joint enterprises, she shows that dramatists did not unconsciously absorb the practice of collaborative writing from general social discourses, but rather were aware of the material and symbolic significances of their work, meanings structured by the traditions of the developing professional theater and by the cultural pressures and anxieties attendant upon a new and often fragile institution.  Very timely and in all sorts of ways highly impressive. . . . The book engages with two significant areas of research within the field of early modern drama studies   collaboration  authorship on the one hand and friendship  affect on the other   and offers significant new material to both.    Gordon McMullan, King s College, London  A groundbreaking book, as it aligns English playing companies and practices with the activities and organization of the London guilds and shows how collaborative efforts in writing plays drew on many of the growing economic practices in Elizabethan and Jacobean England.    Arthur F. Kinney, University of Massachusetts Amherst  Moving fluidly between theoretical models, this is rich, sophisticated, and suggestive--Greenblattian cultural poetics interplay with Bourdieusian sociology, which in turn finds common ground with such positivist theatrical history as that of Gurr, Elliot, and Nelson.    Richard Dutton,  Studies in English Literature  This highly recommended book ranges from the contexts of staging to the psychology of collaboration and the personal and professional associations of dramatists.

England became a centrally important maritime power in the early modern period, and its writers     acutely aware of their inhabiting an island     often depicted the coastline as a major topic of their works. However, early modern English versifiers had to reconcile this reality with the classical tradition, in which the British Isles were seen as culturally remote compared to the centrally important Mediterranean of antiquity. This was a struggle for writers not only because they used the classical tradition to legitimate their authority, but also because this image dominated cognitive maps of the oceanic world. As the first study of coastlines and early modern English literature,  Dire Straits  investigates the tensions of the classical tradition   s isolation of the British Isles from the domain of poetry. By illustrating how early modern English writers created their works in the context of a longstanding cultural inheritance from antiquity, Elizabeth Jane Bellamy offers a new approach to the history of early modern cartography and its influences on literature.  This volume is an ingenious and persuasive tour de force of interdisciplinary research. Highly recommended. -- A.R. Vogeler Dire Straits  is to be welcomed as an important counter-balance to influential histories of the rise of English patriotism and its figuration through geographic discourse    A book which has much to offer to geographers, historians and students of literature alike. --Robert Mayhew    A major contribution to early modern literary studies,  Dire Straits  surfaces watery connections between familiar figures, including Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton, and less well-known ones, including William Bourne and John Cleveland. Elizabeth Jane Bellamy reveals the struggles of English poets to re-define cold and distant British coastlines against sun-drenched and classical Mediterranean shores. Readers interested in the fluvial shapes of English poetry, the influence of the classics, and the career paths of these writers will find much of value here.   -- Steven Mentz, Department of English, St John   s University ","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/bellamys-dire-straits-published\/"},{"title":"Misty Anderson&#039;s Imagining Methodism in Eighteenth Century Britain","content":"Misty Anderson&#039 s Imagining Methodism in Eighteenth Century Britain Imagining Methodism in Eighteenth-Century Britain  Enthusiasm, Belief, and the Borders of the Self By Misty G. Anderson (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2012) In the Eighteenth Century, British Methodism was an object of both derision and desire. Many popular Eighteenth-Century works ridiculed Methodists, yet often the very same plays, novels, and prints that cast Methodists as primitive, irrational, or deluded also betrayed a thinly cloaked fascination with the experiences of divine presence attributed to the new evangelical movement. Anderson argues that writers, actors, and artists used Methodism as a concept to interrogate the boundaries of the self and the fluid relationships between religion and literature, between reason and enthusiasm, and between theater and belief. Imagining Methodism situates works by Henry Fielding, John Cleland, Samuel Foote, William Hogarth, Horace Walpole, Tobias Smollett, and others alongside the contributions of John Wesley, Charles Wesley, and George Whitefield in order to understand how Methodism   s brand of    experimental religion    was both born of the modern world and perceived as a threat to it. Anderson   s analysis of reactions to Methodism exposes a complicated interlocking picture of the religious and the secular   terms less transparent than they seem in current critical usage. Her argument is not about the lives of Eighteenth-Century Methodists  rather, it is about Methodism as it was imagined in the work of Eighteenth-Century British writers and artists, where it served as a sign of sexual, cognitive, and social danger. By situating satiric images of Methodists in their popular contexts, she recaptures a vigorous cultural debate over the domains of religion and literature in the modern British imagination. Rich in cultural and literary analysis, Anderson   s argument will be of interest to students and scholars of the Eighteenth Century, religious studies, theater, and the history of gender.    Imagining Methodism in Eighteenth-Century Britain is well researched and will make a significant contribution to our understanding of Methodism, and to the tensions between reason and religion, in eighteenth-century studies.

Born in 1916 and raised during the Harlem Renaissance under the watchful eye of her beloved maternal grandmother, Alice Childress grew up to become first an actress and then a playwright and novelist.   The influence of Grandmother Eliza-- poor and uneducated, spirited and perceptive-- cannot be discounted in Childress s work.   Her sense of vocation as a writer may have originated in the days when the two would make up stories about passersby on the street beneath their apartment window, with Eliza telling young Alice to write down the good ones  her heartfelt respect for the struggles of ordinary black women likely has its roots in her relationship with the woman who brought her up. A founding member of the American Negro Theatre, Childress became in 1952 the first African-American woman to see her play (Gold through the Trees) professionally produced in New York and in 1956 the first to receive an Obie Award (for  Trouble in Mind).   She is perhaps best known today for  A Hero Ain t Nothin  but a Sandwich, her 1973 novel for young adults about a 13 year-old black boy addicted to heroine.   At the time of her death in 1994, Childress could lay claim to a writing career of more than 40 years in which she examined with honesty and passion the meaning of being black, and especially of being black and female, in a culture where being white and male was what counted.   As Childress herself once said,  I concentrate on portraying have-nots in a have society.  In this first book-length study of the author s life and work, LaVinia Delois Jennings places Childress in the company of such novelists as Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, and Gloria Naylor and such playwrights as Ntozake Shange and Sonia Sanchez.   Like them, Jennings writes, Childress created works that are largely female centered, populated with women  driven by the directives of their rage and convictions  to  embark on quests for self-determination, self-identification, and self-empowerment.  Childress consciously used her writing as a vehicle for social commentary.   The issues that intrigued  her had to do with sexism, racism, and classism and the way they could preclude, often make impossible, the development of a healthy sense of self.   Motivating her decision to become a playwright in the late 1940s was the lack of stage roles-- in both the black and the white theater-- true to the lives of African-American women.   She often ventured into controversial dramatic and literary territory, with the result that her play  Wedding Band (1966), an interracial love story, was optioned for Broadway a dozen times but never produced and her novel  A Hero Ain t Nothin  but a Sandwich was banned by a Long Island school district.   A significant figure in the tradition of African-American theater, young adult fiction, and dramatic and literary writing by and about black women, Alice Childress merits the same heartfelt respect she proffered in her work to the characters who descended from her Grandmother Eliza.","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/la-vinia-delois-jennings-alice-childress-published\/"},{"title":"Sublime Desire: History and Post-1960s Fiction by Amy Elias","content":"Sublime Desire  History and Post-1960s Fiction by Amy Elias Amy Elias s Sublime Desire  History and Post-1960 s Fiction    was published by John Hopkins University Press in 2001 and was the co-winner of the Perkins Prize from the Society for the Study of Narrative Literature.   Elias s work asks   Has twentieth-century political violence destroyed faith in historical knowledge? What happens to historical fiction when history is seen as either a form of Western imperialism or a form of postmodern simulation?  rightcolumn    rightcolumn  In    Sublime Desire, Amy Elias examines our changing relationship to history and how fiction since 1960 reflects that change. She contends that postmodernism is a post-traumatic imagination that is pulled between two desires  the political desire to acknowledge the physical violence of twentieth-century history, and the yearning for an escape from that history into a ravishing realm of historical certainty. Torn between these desires, both historical fiction and historiography after 1960 redefine history as the  sublime,  a territory beyond lived experience that is both unknowable and seductive. In the face of a failure of Enlightenment ideals about knowledge and the West s own history of violence, post-World War II history becomes a desire for the  secular sacred  sublime   for awe, certainty, and belief. Sublime Desire  is an eloquent melding of theory and practice. Mixing the canonical with the unexpected, Elias analyzes developments in the historical romance genre from Walter Scott s novels to novels written today. She correlates developments in the historical romance to similar changes in historiography and philosophy.    Sublime Desire  draws engagingly on more than thirty relevant texts, from Tolstoy s    War and Peace  to Jeanette Winterson s    Sexing the Cherry, Charles Johnson s  Dreamer, and Charles Frazier s    Cold Mountain. But the book also examines theories of postmodern space and time and defines the difference between postmodern and postcolonial historical perspectives. The final chapter draws from trauma theory in Holocaust studies to define how fiction can pose an ethical alternative to aestheticized history while remaining open to pluralism and democratic values. In its range and sophistication,    Sublime Desire  is a valuable addition to postmodernist studies as well as to studies of the historical romance novel.    Sublime Desire  constitutes a major contribution to the growing body of work on contemporary historical fiction... a must for those who wonder about the pervasivenessof history in comtemporary literature.     Luc Herman - Review of Contemporary Fiction  Elias sets out to deepen our understanding of the ethical and political power of the historical romance, then and now...

One of the most widely read and studied texts produced in Late Antiquity is the prison diary of a young woman who was martyred in the year 202 or 203 C.E. in Carthage, as part of a civic celebration. Her name was Perpetua, and, despite her honorable marriage and her baby son, she refused to recant her faith after she was arrested with a group of Christians. Imprisoned with her was a slave girl called Felicitas, who was in an advanced state of pregnancy. Felicitas gave birth just before she entered the arena, where the two women were mauled by wild animals and died with their fellow inmates. A description of their heroic deaths is appended to the diary by an editor, who tells us that, as they died, Perpetua and Felicitas arranged each other s clothes modestly and finally bid farewell in this life with the kiss of peace.

Smollet   s second novel, a picaresque satirical portrait of 18th century Europe, was originally published in 1751. Following the fortunes and misfortunes of the egotistical dandy Peregrine Pickle, the novel is written as a series of brief adventures with every chapter typically describing a new escapade. The novel begins with Peregrine as a young country gentleman. His mother rejects him, as do his aloof father and his dissolute, spiteful brother. Commodore Hawser Trunnion takes Peregrine under his care and raises him. Peregrine   s upbringing, education at Oxford, and journey to France, his debauchery, bankruptcy, jailing, and succession to his father   s fortune, and his final repentance and marriage to his beloved Emilia all provide scope for Smollett   s comic and caustic perspective on the Europe of his times. As John P. Zomchick and George S. Rousseau note in the introduction,    by contrasting the genteel and the common, the sophisticated and the primal, Smollett conveys forcefully the way it felt to be alive in the middle of the eighteenth century.    The introduction provides an overview of the composition and publication history of Peregrine Pickle and discusses the novel   s critical reception over time by such figures as Lady Luxborough, Sir Walter Scott, Joseph Conrad, and George Orwell. The text of the novel uses the first edition of 1751 as copy-text while recording the second edition   s substantive variants. Included are illustrations by Thomas Rowlandson, Richard Corbould, and George Cruikshank, as well as frontispieces designed by, and engraved in the style of, Henry Fuseli.

Haddox examines the work of six avowedly Christian writers of fiction in the period from World War II to the present. This period is often characterized in western societies by such catchphrases as    postmodernism    and    secularization,    with the frequent implication that orthodox belief in the dogmas of Christianity has become untenable among educated readers. How, then, do we account for the continued existence of writers of self-consciously literary fiction who attempt to persuade readers of the truth, desirability, and utility of the dogmas of Christianity? Is it possible to take these writers    efforts on their own terms and to understand and evaluate the rhetorical strategies that this kind of persuasion might entail? Informed by the school of rhetorical narratology that includes such critics as Wayne Booth, James Phelan, and Richard Walsh,  Hard Sayings  offers fresh new readings of fictive works by Flannery O   Connor, Muriel Spark, John Updike, Walker Percy, Mary Gordon, and Marilynne Robinson. In its argument that orthodox Christianity, as represented in fiction, still has the power to persuade and to trouble, it contributes to ongoing debates about the nature and scope of modernity, postmodernity, and secularization.    Anyone who teaches courses in religion and literature will benefit greatly from this book.  Hard Sayings  promises to be a major work in that field.       Paul J. Contino, Seaver Professor of Humanities, Pepperdine University, and editor of  Christianity and Literature    Thomas F. Haddox has refreshingly returned literary judgment to the act of criticism in this excellent study of six late-modern novelists  Mary Gordon, Flannery O   Connor, Walker Percy, Marilynne Robinson, Muriel Spark, and John Updike. Though they all purport to take Christianity seriously, Haddox shows that they often undermine their own intentions. The problem arises not at the level of theological orthodoxy so much as in the making of fundamental literary decisions  about narrative voice and tone, about direct and indirect discourse, about sympathetic and hostile characterization, as well as the openness or finality of their endings.

Haddox s  Fears and Fascinations  Representing Catholicism in the American South (Fordham UP) is an  innovative book that charts what has been a largely unexplored literary landscape, looking at the work of such diverse writers as the gens de couleur libre poets of antebellum New Orleans, Kate Chopin, Mark Twain, Carson McCullers, Margaret Mitchell, Allen Tate, Caroline Gordon, Flannery O Connor, Walker Percy, and John Kennedy Toole. Haddox shows that Catholicism and its Church have always been a presence, albeit in different ways, in the southern cultural tradition. For some, Catholicism has been associated with miscegenation and with the political aspirations of African-Americans  for others, it has served as the model for the feudal and patriarchal society that some southern whites sought to establish  for still others, it has presented a gorgeous aesthetic spectacle associated with decadence and homoeroticism  and for still others, it has marked a quotidian, do-it-yourself lifestyle attractive for its lack of concern with southern anxieties about honor. By focusing on the shifting and contradictory ways Catholicism has signified within southern literature and culture, Fears and Fascinations contributes to a more nuanced understanding of American and southern literary and cultural history.

Kenney (University of Dallas) was published by the University of Toronto Press in 2012.  The cult of the Christ Child flourished in late medieval Europe across lay and religious, as well as geographic and cultural boundaries. Depictions of Christ s boyhood are found throughout popular culture, visual art, and literature.  The Christ Child in Medieval Culture  is the first interdisciplinary investigation of how representations of the Christ Child were conceptualized and employed in this period. The contributors to this unique volume analyse depictions of the Christ Child through a variety of frameworks, including the interplay of mortality and divinity, the medieval conceit of a suffering Christ Child, and the interrelationships between Christ and other figures, including saints and ordinary children.  The Christ Child in Medieval Culture  synthesizes various approaches to interpreting the cultural meaning of medieval religious imagery and illuminates the significance of its most central figure.

Featuring new critical essays by scholars from Europe, South America, and the United States, the collection presents a wide-ranging look at how whiteness--defined in terms of race or ethnicity--forms a category toward which people strive in order to gain power and privilege. Collectively these pieces treat global spaces whose nation building and identity formation have turned on biological and genealogical exigencies to whiten themselves. Drawing upon racialized, national practices implemented prior to and during the twentieth century, each of the essays enlists literature or performance to reflect the sociopolitical imperatives that secured whiteness in the respective locations they study. They range from examinations of whiteness in the literature of Appalachia and contemporary Argentinean poetry to an analysis of performances memorializing the colonial experience in Italy and an exploration into the white rap music of Eminem and contemporary multiracial passing. As the contributors show, literary and performance representations have the power to chronicle histories that reflect the behaviors and lived realities of our selves. Whether whiteness, in addition to its physical manifestation, presents itself as identity, symbol, racism, culture, social formation, political imposition, legal imposition, or pathology, it has been outed into the visible, even in national spaces where the term    whiteness    has yet to be translated and entered into the official lexicon. The ten essays collected here provide powerful insights into where and how the race for biological and genealogical whiteness persists in various geopolitical realms and the ways in which Nordic whites, as well as ethnic whites and nonwhites, resecure its ascendance.

Building on the special journal issue of Victorian Studies devoted to Victorian investments, this volume is the first to define an interdisciplinary field of study emerging in the space between Marxist critiques of capitalism and traditional histories of business and economics. The contributors demonstrate how phenomena such as the expansion of colonial and foreign markets, the broadening of the investor base through the advent of limited liability, and the rise of financial journalism gave rise to a  culture of investment  that affected Victorian Britons at every level of society and influenced every kind of cultural production. Drawing together work by prominent historians as well as literary and cultural critics, Victorian Investments both defines the methodologies and perspectives that characterize an existing body of scholarship and pushes that scholarship in new directions, demonstrating the signal role of economic developments in Victorian culture and society.  Serious, ample, and provocative, the essays are an important addition to the literature of nineteenth-century finance and offer constructive consideration of a fundamental feature of the practice and myths of capitalism as we continue to live with and in them.

Modernism has long been understood as a radical repudiation of the past. Reading against the narrative of modernism-as-break,  Pragmatic Modernism  traces an alternative strain of modernist thought that grows out of pragmatist philosophy and is characterized by its commitment to gradualism, continuity, and recontextualization. It rediscovers a distinctive response to the social, intellectual, and artistic transformations of modernity in the work of Henry James, Marcel Proust, Gertrude Stein, Oliver Wendell Holmes, John Dewey, and William James. These thinkers share an institutionally-grounded approach to change which emphasizes habits, continuities, and daily life over spectacular events, heroic opposition, and radical rupture. They developed an active, dialectical attitude that was critical of complacency while refusing to romanticize moments of shock or conflict. Through its analysis of pragmatist keywords, including  habit,   institution,   prediction,  and  bigness,   Pragmatic Modernism  offers new readings of works by James, Proust, Stein, and Andre Breton, among others. It shows, for instance, how Stein s characteristic literary innovation--her repetitions--aesthetically materialize the problem of habit  and how institutions--businesses, museums, newspapers, the law, and even the state itself--help to construct the subtlest of personal observations and private gestures in James s novels. This study reconstructs an overlooked strain of modernism. In so doing, it helps to re-imagine the stark choice between political quietism and total revolution that has been handed down as modernism s legacy.  Pragmatic Modernism  is an impressive work of intellectual and literary history. It s clearly the product of deep reading and understanding and a real devotion to the ideas and thinkers it painstakingly explains and uses. It will strongly appeal to Americanists, modernists, and intellectual historians.  --Ross Posnock, Columbia University  Establishing continuities between philosophical pragmatism and the work of modernist writers, Lisi Schoenbach s sustained analysis of the idea of habit provides a hugely impressive rethinking of the intellectual genealogy of modernism. Pragmatism s attention to everyday minutiae and social complexity informs Schoenbach s incisive re-readings. A wonderfully gripping and thought-provoking work of scholarship.  --Michael Sheringham, University of Oxford  Clearly written and forcefully argued, Lisi Schoenbach s book contrasts the avant-garde s reliance on  shock  with the pragmatists  attention to  habit.  The result is a compelling revisionist account of modernism by way of splendid readings of Gertrude Stein and Henry James in company with the pragmatist trio of William James, John Dewey, and Oliver Wendell Holmes.  --John McGowan, University of North Carolina  One of the most refreshing treatments of transatlantic modernism I ve read in a long time, Lisi Schoenbach s  Pragmatic Modernism  highlights a crucial yet neglected strain of modernist thought and practice that stresses the dialectic between habit and rupture, the importance of institutionalization, and the value of recontextualization in contrast to immediate and total transformation.  --George B.

But in a period of austerity and in the wake of high-profile disasters like Challenger, that dream has ended. In early 2011, Margaret Lazarus Dean traveled to Cape Canaveral for NASA   s last three space shuttle launches in order to bear witness to the end of an era. With Dean as our guide to Florida   s Space Coast and to the history of NASA, Leaving Orbit takes the measure of what American spaceflight has achieved while reckoning with its earlier witnesses like Norman Mailer, Tom Wolfe, and Oriana Fallaci. Along the way Dean meets NASA workers, astronauts, and space fans, gathering possible answers to the question  what does it mean that a spacefaring nation won   t be going to space anymore?

The book has, at its centre, an understanding of narrative as both a practice that is central to what it means to be human and an analytical tool for understanding policy and culture. The book uses a wide range of case studies to illustrate the importance of this dual understanding of narrative to account for debates and differences between understandings of global culture as potentially threatening, in the form of globalization, or liberating, in the form of transnationalism. The case studies range from film and media studies, historical examples of Berlin and the USA   s National Endowment for the Arts, as well as questions over cultural heritage, through to readings of fictional case studies using the same narrative methods. The book will be essential reading for all scholars working in cultural policy and cultural studies, but also represents a challenge to the mainstream approaches of political science thinking about public policy. Milena Dragicevic ee ic, University of Arts, Belgrade, Serbia, says of the book   DeVereaux and Griffin present a persuasive argument that cultural policy is located within a framework of different narratives that may be neither recognized nor understood.

Focusing on the term   s significance as an organizing principle of Christian repentance, she examines the ways in which Shakespeare and his contemporaries dramatized the consequences of its re- or de-valuation in the process of Reformation doctrinal change. The Protestant theology of repentance, Hirschfeld suggests, underwrote a variety of theatrical plots    to set things right    in a world shorn of the prospect of    making enough    (satisfacere). Hirschfeld   s semantic history traces today   s use of    satisfaction      as an unexamined measure of inward gratification rather than a finely nuanced standard of relational exchange   to the pressures on legal, economic, and marital discourses wrought by the Protestant rejection of the Catholic sacrament of penance (contrition, confession, satisfaction) and represented imaginatively on the stage. In so doing, it offers fresh readings of the penitential economies of canonical plays including  Dr. Faustus,  The Revenger   s Tragedy,  The Merchant of Venice, and  Othello  considers the doctrinal and generic importance of lesser-known plays including  Enough Is as Good as a Feast  and  Love   s Pilgrimage  and opens new avenues into the study of literature and repentance in early modern England. Reviews   Heather Hirschfeld is an astute reader of early modern English dramatic texts and an authoritative voice on the wide-ranging effects of the Reformation on English literary culture (and vice versa). In  The End of Satisfaction, Hirschfeld turns her sharp attention to the theological idea of satisfaction and its doctrinal ramifications across a host of related experiences and discourses   the question of hell, the impossibility of fulfillment through revenge, financial repayment, and the social and psychic costs of marriage.    Gail Kern Paster, author of  The Body Embarrassed  Drama and the Disciplines of Shame in Early Modern England  The End of Satisfaction  will become a touchstone for future debates over the legacy of the Reformation on the early modern stage and the role played there by satisfaction in the widest sense of the word.

The continued importance of Christian rhetorics in political, social, pedagogical, and civic affairs suggests that such rhetorics not only belong on the map of rhetorical studies, but are indeed essential to the geography of rhetorical studies in the twenty-first century. This collection argues that concerning ourselves with religious rhetorics in general and Christian rhetorics in particular tells us something about rhetoric itself   its boundaries, its characteristics, its functionings. In assembling original research on the intersections of rhetoric and Christianity from prominent and emerging scholars,  Mapping Christian Rhetorics  seeks to locate religion more centrally within the geography of rhetorical studies in the twenty-first century. It does so by acknowledging work on Christian rhetorics that has been overlooked or ignored  connecting domains of knowledge and research areas pertaining to Christian rhetorics that may remain disconnected or under connected  and charting new avenues of inquiry about Christian rhetorics that might invigorate theory-building, teaching, research, and civic engagement. In dividing the terrain of Christian rhetorics into four categories   theory, education, methodology, and civic engagement   Mapping Christian Rhetorics  aims to foster connections among these areas of inquiry and spur future future collaboration between scholars of religious rhetoric in a range of research areas.

Here   s how the press describes the book  In Africa, the development of    dictatorship fiction    as a vehicle for depicting the authoritarian state arose more slowly than in other parts of the world. The dictator novel emerged earlier in Latin America, as the region   s anticolonial disengagement preceded that of Africa. Thus, the Latin American variant of this literary genre has been extensively studied, but until now there has been no comparable exploration of the fictional and dramatic representations of tyrannical regimes in Africa.

Survivance, Sovereignty, and Story  is a necessary call for pedagogical change in the way students learn about native peoples. For too long, teachers have relied on colonial narratives to explain native histories and cultures instead of incorporating native expressions of survivance into their curriculums. The important collection assembled by King, Gubele, and Anderson offers classroom strategies on how to combat cultural appropriations and stereotypes. By using a spectrum of native rhetorics   art, song, oral testimonies, literature, and activist commentary   indigenous voices and perspectives can be placed at the forefront of teaching about indigenous realities.

It is one of the ironies of contemporary literary study that as it has moved toward greater interdisciplinarity it has grown sceptical of the aesthetic. This anthology reasserts the continuing relevance of the aesthetic and to reintegrate it into the widening repertoire of contemporary literary critical practices.  rightcolumn    rightcolumn  From its inception literary aesthetics has been engaged in the full range of debates generated by the criticism of culture. Unlike the more restricted discourse of philosophical aesthetics, it has explored the ways in which value commitments extend across disciplinary domains by reckoning with the practical concerns of art production and consumption.The readings in this anthology reach back to classical sources of philosophical aesthetics and forward to the most current accounts of the utility value of the literary artwork in post-modern culture. The organization of the text is designed to engage the reader in the shaping debates of literary aesthetic theory and demonstrate their continuing relevance for our understanding of the ways literature sustains and critiques culture.    This volume can be strongly recommended as a first reader in aesthetics for interested students of literature.

On Thursday, August 13th, from 1 00-2 00pm, Driscoll will give a talk  entitled Writing Transfer and  METACOGNITION  as Frameworks for  Success in College  Writing and Beyond,  in 1210 McClung Tower.   Professor Driscoll s talk will be followed by a workshop on   Fostering Metacognitive Awareness for First Year Writing and Writing Transfer,  from 2 15-3 45pm, in the same location. Two of the most critical questions teachers of writing face today are how students transfer knowledge and skills gained in first-year writing (FYW) to other contexts and how to best teach for writing transfer. This presentation will explore some of what happens to FYW knowledge by drawing upon research from two data sets  a two-year, multi-institutional  study of writing transfer (The Writing Transfer Project) and a five-year longitudinal study of fifteen college writers. Drawing on these two data sets, Professor Driscoll will emphasize the role that metacognition plays in subsequent writing transfer and learning development. Dr. Dana Driscoll is an Associate Professor of English at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, where she is a member of the Composition and TESOL Ph.D. faculty. Her scholarly interests include writing transfer, empirical mixed research methodologies, the scholarship of teaching and learning, and writing centers. Her work has appeared in journals such as Computers and Composition, Composition Forum, Writing Center Journal, Writing Program Administration, and Teaching and Learning Inquiry. Her co-authored article won the International Writing Center Association   s 2012 Outstanding Article of the Year Award. Dr. Driscoll is currently part of the Writing Transfer Project, a multi-institutional research team conducting a mixed-methods, longitudinal study to evaluate the effectiveness of a reflective, metacognitive approach to writing instruction. She also serves on the Executive Board of CCCC. Dr. Driscoll holds a Ph.D. in Rhetoric and Composition from Purdue University. The English Department   s Annual Teaching Workshops are an important factor in our writing program being nationally recognized with  a CCCC Writing Program  Certificate of Excellence award. For those who are new to UTK, these workshops provide an  introduction to our program and to the departmental context in which it is situated. For our returning  graduate students and lecturers, the workshops provide a chance to renew and share information and to  learn about innovative approaches to teaching writing.","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/professor-dana-lynn-driscoll-to-give-keynote-talk-for-2015-teaching-workshops\/"},{"title":"Radical Orientalism: Rights, Reform, and Romanticism by Gerard Cohen-Vrignaud Published by Cambridge University Press","content":"Radical Orientalism  Rights, Reform, and Romanticism by Gerard Cohen-Vrignaud Published by Cambridge University Press Radical Orientalism  Rights, Reform, and Romanticism by Gerard Cohen-Vrignaud was published by Cambridge University Press in July 2015 and is part of their  Cambridge Studies in Romanticism  series.  rightcolumn    rightcolumn  This fascinating study reveals the extent to which the Orientalism of Byron and the Shelleys resonated with the reformist movement of the Romantic era. It documents how and why radicals like Bentham, Cobbett, Carlile, Hone and Wooler, among others in post-Revolutionary Britain, invoked Turkey, North Africa and Mughal India when attacking and seeking to change their government s domestic policies. Examining a broad archive ranging from satires, journalism, tracts, political and economic treatises, and public speeches, to the exotic poetry and fictions of canonical Romanticism, Gerard Cohen-Vrignaud shows that promoting colonization was not Orientalism s sole ideological function. Equally vital was its aesthetic and rhetorical capacity to alienate the people s affection from their rulers and fuel popular opposition to regressive taxation, penal cruelty, police repression, and sexual regulation.","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/radical-orientalism-rights-reform-and-romanticism-by-gerard-cohen-vrignaud\/"},{"title":"Chantal Bizzini\u2019s Disenchanted City Translated by Marilyn Kallet, J. Bradford Anderson and Darren Jackson","content":"Chantal Bizzini   s Disenchanted City Translated by Marilyn Kallet, J. Bradford Anderson and Darren Jackson Disenchanted City  by Chantal Bizzini was  translated by Marilyn Kallet, J. Bradford Anderson and Darren Jackson and published by Black Widow Press in 2015.    What a vortex of creation this Chantal Bizzini is, shredding and whirling reality, recombining it, watching it glitter and flash and explode when the touches it with her eye and heart and hand. After too many years of pale, abstract French verse, it is a delight to welcome her into English translation. She knows so much and feels so much that any reader of these poems will be the wiser and the happier for encountering her.          Bill Zavatsky Chantal Bizzini   s  Disenchanted City  bravely portrays the real world we live in with its    Red-eye flights, skidding cars, words, broken glass,    but the poet also sees with a visionary glance. She views the landscapes of the twenty-first century through the lens of the arts, where she draws from a personal encyclopedia that ranges from Renaissance images of a pierced Saint Sebastian to the jazz solos of Eric Dolphy. In Bizzini   s poetic looking glass, art translates the devastation of modern life into glittering moments, as in this homage to a musician     when you play, the anguish born to bear witness to the trembling edges of things once in a while disappears.       Zack Rogow    Here is an edgy, urban French poet whose wit is shot through with lyricism, whose painterly eye and polyglot jazz- inflected ear perceive and recreate a 21st century impressionist   s capital where both Hart Crane and Walter Benjamin might feel inspired to wander.           Marilyn Hacker The poems in Chantal Bizzini   s new book,  Disenchanted City, are urban, personal, complex and sophisticated  they are also poems of displacement. In these poems Bizzini, a visual artist and translator, channels the sometimes dark world of a contemporary France peopled by criminals, immigrants and other marginal people invisible to the eyes of many French citizens. The poet writes in her poem    Jazz        morning in an unknown neighborhood it   s the same city, but I don   t recognize it it has zones of dust large streets the steps climb some people a little strange make ordinary gestures someone calls, someone talks of weather and of the sky and clouds that pass through the common existence in the shivering cold of the first hours  and little by little we enter this day having measured what makes it different because it is the attempt at perception.    Isn   t this how most of us react in this modern world filled with enigmas, trying to understand and process difference? This is a haunting, beautiful, powerful, disturbing book filled unsettling poems set in a world of unsettling complexities.

Dr. Webster   s presentation will consider the imagined future publics of Navajos who write poetry in a variety of languages and especially in Navajo and how considerations of those publics may disincline Navajos to write in Navajo. He will discuss some of the motivations that some Navajos have for writing in Navajo and the kinds of audiences that they imagine reading their work. For example, one Navajo consultant wrote poetry in Navajo for her grandchildren who did not speak the language. She hoped, however, that in writing poetry in Navajo that contained messages to them, it would encourage her grandchildren to learn the language. Dr. Webster notes that such imagined potential Navajo reading publics also have other evocations. They allow us to encounter the question of the ways a certain dominant language ideology of standardization has crept into Navajo views about writing Navajo. Dr. Webster will also look at how such potential critical audiences of written Navajo poetry seem to have led to the emergence of poetry composed and performed in Navajo on YouTube. This recent emergent trend echoes a thought experiment that one Navajo poet suggested to Dr, Webster in 2010     It could be a way of resistance  I don   t write Navajo poetry, I just speak the poetry in Navajo.    It also re-imagines a future public not of just Navajos understanding Navajo, but rather of Navajo as a world language.

Contributors promote understanding of American Indian rhetorical and literary texts and the cultures and contexts within which those texts are produced. Chapters also supply resources for instructors, promote cultural awareness, offer suggestions for further research, and provide examples of methods to incorporate American Indian texts into the classroom curriculum. Survivance, Sovereignty, and Story  provides a decolonized vision of what teaching rhetoric and writing can be and offers a foundation to talk about what rhetoric and pedagogical practice can mean when examined through American Indian and indigenous epistemologies and contemporary rhetorics.

Powell, Andrea Riley-Mukavetz, Gabriela Raquel R  os, and Sundy Watanabe.  Survivance, Sovereignty, and Story  is a necessary call for pedagogical change in the way students learn about native peoples. For too long, teachers have relied on colonial narratives to explain native histories and cultures instead of incorporating native expressions of survivance into their curriculums. The important collection assembled by King, Gubele, and Anderson offers classroom strategies on how to combat cultural appropriations and stereotypes. By using a spectrum of native rhetorics   art, song, oral testimonies, literature, and activist commentary   indigenous voices and perspectives can be placed at the forefront of teaching about indigenous realities.

But when insects began to be scanned with the newfangled microscope in the seventeenth century, what new challenges did they pose?

NEXUS is a  a biennial, graduate-student-run conference. NEXUS, which began in 2004 as a speaker   s symposium organized by then President of the Graduate Students in English  Brian Gempp,  aims to bring together scholars, creative writers, and educators from a broad range of disciplines in order to provide a space to share the myriad ways that humans communicate about an endangered environment and recommend avenues for future research. This conference also seeks to expand the ways in which scholars link discussions about communication and the environment such that the natural world becomes one environment among many which shapes our ideas about communication.   The theme for this year   s conference is    Alt + Shift  Unlocking Alternative Methodologies and Marginal Positions.        This year   s conference will feature plenary speakers Dr. Andrea Kitta, a folklorist specializing in public health  Dr. Dorothea Lasky, a highly regarded poet  and Dr. Malea Powell, who works in American Indian material rhetorics and decolonizing methodologies.   A complete conference schedule is available  here. The short-key action    Alt+Shift    is supposed to change the keyboard language. However, this function no longer changes these language settings, as it once could do, and it may not regain functioning without altering the system itself. To help change and alter the system, more research and collaboration is needed. In the same way, this conference seeks to promote connectivity between various disciplines and their approaches to changing mainstream research to recover marginal voices and discover effective alternative methodologies. Recent conversations concerning immigration, environment, vaccinations, LGBTQ communities, women, race, and violence have illustrated ongoing concerns of alienation and subjugation of marginalized perspectives in society. While the topics of debate are not new, the presence of these conversations are exposing the oppressive effects associated with mainstream narratives and dominant research paradigms. This conference aims to bring together scholars, creative writers, and educators from a broad range of disciplines in order to provida space to share the myriad ways that scholars are alternatively researching materials and recovering marginalized voices from the prevailing dominant paradigms. While the rise in use of alternative methodologies has opened up new opportunities for research, social action, and expression by previously under-recognized and underrepresented groups, important questions remain. Particularly, how can we actively shift from the idea of    other    in such a way that the foundation of research practice changes?","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/nexus-2016-interdisciplinary-graduate-conference-alt-shift-unlocking-alternative-methodologies-and-marginal-positions\/"},{"title":"Poet Cameron Conway to Read on Monday, 3\/7","content":"Poet Cameron Conway to Read on Monday, 3 7 On Monday, 3 7, at 7pm, Poet Cameron Conway will read from his works at the Writers in the Library series, in the Lindsay Young Auditorium of the John C.

Working with the Community Coalition Against Human Trafficking,  several  students in Dr. Misty Anderson s English 411 class organized the    Human Trafficking on Rocky Top event    to bring awareness to the local sex trafficking industry, its effects on society and ways to help end modern-day slavery.

On Friday, April 1, from noon to 1 30pm, in the Mary Greer Room of Hodges Library, Bryan Wagner, Associate Professor of English at UC Berkeley will lecture on    The People   s Court.        Professor Wagner   s lecture  surveys the development of the police court in the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  As he describes it  Police courts were tribunals where officials resolved disputes and punished misdemeanants (including vagrants, prostitutes, and petty thieves) without recourse to formal jurisprudence. They were also popular entertainment, attracting numerous spectators who were engrossed not only by conflicts and confessions but also by the mechanics of the justice system. In this lecture, I am interested in the legal education that audiences took away from these tribunals, or in how they came to know law as theater, as prerogative, and as process. The official records produced by these courts were sparse, when they were kept at all, but we have access to a rich secondary archive--satirical newspaper columns and cartoons, mock-epic poems and theatrical set-pieces, vaudeville recordings and sheet music, radio transcriptions and courtroom anecdotes collected as folklore--that can help us to reconstruct these proceedings in substantial and often lurid detail. Keyed to a situation in which status depends on embodiment rather than abstract  rights and on role-playing rather than principled deliberation, these neglected sources reveal the extent to which knowledge of law has been mediated by popular entertainment conventions. Bryan Wagner is Associate Professor in the English Department at UC Berkeley. His research focuses on African American expression in the context of slavery and its aftermath, with a particular focus on legal history and critical theory. His first book,  Disturbing the Peace  Black Culture and the Police Power after Slavery  (Harvard University Press, 2009) revises the history of the black vernacular tradition and gives a new account of black culture by reading these myths in the context of the tradition   s ongoing engagement with the law.   His second book,  The Tar Baby  A Global History, is forthcoming this spring from Princeton University Press.   For those who can stay on after his lecture and subsequent Q&A, Professor Wagner will lead a brief, informal discussion of  The Tar Baby, ending around 2pm.

English 254  Themes in Literature fulfills the General Education requirement for a WC course.   The following are the The themes we will be offering in Fall 2016. Topic     Satire and Society    Dr. Mark Tabone   Course Description  This course looks at how authors use hilarity, parody, gallows humor, mockery, absurdity, grotesquery, burlesque, surrealism, utopia and dystopia in order to critique their societies and advocate for social change. We will examine classical and neoclassical satire beginning with Aristophanes    Lysistrata (recently adapted by Spike Lee), but the majority of the course will be devoted to some of the funniest, sharpest, and most bizarre writing from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Topic     Pirates    Dr. Ereck Jarvis Course Description  Our class will consistently pursue what literature about pirates has to tell us about modernity in the West & what it can reveal about governance,  commerce,  race, gender, & sexuality. In general, our crew will consist of pirates from the late seventeenth & early eighteenth centuries, a period sometimes referred to as the    golden age    of piracy. However, these piratical figures will come to us from literature written throughout the last 300 years. Reading enlightenment,  romanticist, realist, modern, & postmodern works, we will consider why various authors and their cultures take an interest in maritime rapscallions of the past. We will plunder the literature of piracy in search of what it might turn over regarding the history of English literature and of English-speaking societies. Topic     War in the Graphic Novel    Dr. Kelli MacCartey Course Description  In this course, students will have the opportunity to explore the themes of survival, communication, and freedom in times of war exclusively through the genre of the graphic novel. The notion of conflict and identity will serve as foundations for class discussions. Conflict arises in many forms during war  national vs. individual identity  differing religious beliefs  freedom of speech vs. censorship  political strife  and economic disparity. How people negotiate these conflicts to survive, maintain their freedom, and communicate their struggles is the focus of this course. We   ll cover WWII, the war in Iraq, Rwandan genocide, middle-eastern conflicts, and even nuclear war, among other global events.     Students will write essays and reading responses, take quizzes, and create a final project to showcase their knowledge of this exciting genre and topic.

Dr. Billone will speak in conjunction with the Knoxville stop of a traveling exhibition, Harry Potter   s World  Renaissance Science, Magic and Medicine, that explores the link between Harry Potter and the history of science using materials from the National Library of Medicine. In 1997, British author J. K. Rowling introduced the world to Harry Potter and a literary phenomenon was born. Although the story is a fantasy, the magic in the Harry Potter books is partially based on Renaissance traditions that played an important role in the development of Western science and medicine. Incorporating the work of several fifteenth- and sixteenth-century thinkers, the exhibit examines important ethical topics such as the desire for knowledge, the effects of prejudice, and the responsibility that comes with power.   Billone   s areas of expertise are nineteenth-century literature and children   s and young adult literature. An accomplished poet, she also has a background in creative writing.

The Department of English wish to congratulate our 2016 Chancellor Award Winners    Kali Mobley, who  won the Graduate Student Teaching Award,  Heather Hirschfeld, who  was given the award for Excellence in Teaching, and  Anthony Welch,  who received the Alumni Outstanding Teacher Award.   You can read what the Chancellor s Honor Program said about these outstanding teachers below. The  Graduate Student Teaching Award  honors graduate student excellence in instruction. Kali Mobley is a doctoral candidate in rhetoric, writing, and linguistics. Her excellent teaching reviews have prompted her more experienced colleagues to take their own notes about tips to improve their courses. She works to create community in the classroom and presents ideas so that they are accessible to all levels. She was appointed assistant director of the Writing Center and tutor trainer for first-year graduate students, a position the department entrusts to their best tutors and teachers.   2016 Graduate Teaching Award The Excellence in Teaching Award is bestowed by the Office of the Chancellor and the Teaching Council of the Faculty Senate to honor outstanding work in the classroom. Heather Hirschfeld   s student-centered teaching practice    grows out of the belief that original, creative insights about centuries-old texts are uniquely available to the students who populate  her  courses, both majors and nonmajors alike, and that  she has  much to learn from them.    Students praise Hirschfeld for her expertise in the field of Renaissance literature and for her contagious enthusiasm, which they feel plays a central role in making the sometimes difficult material accessible to them. One English major remarked that she    was inspired to try to match  Hirschfeld   s  intellect.      2016 Excellence in Teaching Award The Alumni Outstanding Teacher  awards are bestowed by the UT Alumni Association to recognize teaching excellence. Anthony Welch, associate professor of English, seeks ways to maintain relationships with his students outside the classroom. He has organized widely popular marathon oral readings and orchestrated a study abroad course in Stratford and London. Welch is a specialist in English Renaissance literature, particularly works written between 1500 and 1700. He brings a learned and engaging presence to the classroom. His students cherish his ability to make difficult texts and their rich historical contexts come to life in sophisticated and imaginative ways. A student wrote,    He brings a fresh, lively outlook to the material he teaches. He has a captivating voice, he does more work for the class than any other teacher I   ve ever had, and he makes slightly dry material very entertaining and extremely thought-provoking. I wish I could stay at UT another year just to take more classes with him.       UTK Honors Banquet, Alumni Outstanding Teacher Award Extraordinary Professional Promise  honors are awarded to undergraduate and graduate students who demonstrate professional promise in teaching, research or other contributions.   Undergraduates Jasmine Jones and Grace Rotz both received Extraordinary Professional Promise Awards.

This was a real-life assignment that I recently lived through, folks.  rightcolumn      rightcolumn  It   s hard to believe that last year about this time I was delving into the works of Cormac McCarthy with Dr. Hardwig and refining my poetic skills with Dr. Kallet. Fast forward a year later, and I am delving into foreign policy and discussing why Congress is at gridlock. I was nervous to begin working towards my Masters in Public Policy and Administration and for good reason. Unlike my colleagues, I had never taken a political science course. Although I was intimidated at first, I quickly realized that my English and Theatre undergraduate degree (sprinkled with life experience) was causing me to excel in graduate school. I have learned that you can connect and apply almost every skill that you learn throughout your personal journey.  leftcolumn    leftcolumn  My junior year at UT, I studied abroad in England. This was appropriate as I have a true and deep passion for Shakespeare. I flitted around Europe (think Amy in  Little Women), learning a little about different cultures and learning a lot about myself. When I returned, I applied for the Tennessee Legislative Internship on a whim. I think in my head it was an opportunity to (once again) live in a new city and try on some of Elle Wood   s shoes for size. Often times, I view new experiences as a way to do a character-study on myself. It   s the thespian in me, I suppose.  rightcolumn    rightcolumn  After I received the internship, I fell in love quickly and without hesitation. I fell in love with Nashville and the legislative process entirely. My internship with UT   s Office of Government Relations and Advocacy was an invaluable experience. The program and those I met along the way were key in leading me to other learning opportunities. I have now successfully worked in all branches of government and at all levels of government. Last semester I lived in D.C where I interned for U.S. Senator Bob Corker through the Chancellor   s Congressional Internship Program. I received graduate credit for my time there, and I learned a plethora of knowledge about Tennessee constituents and foreign policy. This summer I worked in Chancellor Cheek   s Office while also interning for Blount County Mayor Ed Mitchell through CTAS. At the end of the summer, I was given the opportunity to continue working for the County in the Human Resources Office.   I graduate in May, and I couldn   t be more excited to see where life takes me.  leftcolumn    leftcolumn  Over the last two years my journey has been pretty crazy   crazy awesome, I mean. I have learned so much about myself and the career I  sort of stumbled  came upon.   I wouldn   t say that I have life all figured out   or anything figured out, really  but I think knowing that you don   t actually know anything is half (if not most) of the battle. This notion allows us to continue learning about the world that surrounds us, and most importantly, it allows us to keep learning about ourselves. So study prose, or study politics, or, like me, study both   but whatever you study don   t forget to study yourself along the way.","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/4211-2\/"},{"title":"&#8220;In Our Own Words&#8221;: Clay Jeffries Discusses English 492: Drama in New York","content":"&#8220 In Our Own Words&#8221   Clay Jeffries Discusses English 492  Drama in New York MANhattan E.B. White once said that no one should come to New York unless they are very lucky. Through the University of Tennessee, I had the opportunity to go on a trip to New York City December 11-21 for a course titled, Drama in New York, and I feel very, very lucky. The course allowed me to see eight shows and journal about my experience, with a research component due the following semester   and by doing this I will attain a three-hour course credit for an upper-level English class. From the moment I stepped into the city, I knew this was going to be a special place for me. I felt at home in a city that was 890 miles away. What I didn   t know was that the next ten days were going to be some of the best (if not the best) days of my life. I have loved theatre my entire life and strutting down the streets of Manhattan on my way to a Broadway show had always been a dream of mine. That dream became reality my first day in the city. My friend and I visited the Statue of Liberty before a matinee of King Charles III, but upon our return we took the wrong train and wound up on the opposite side of the city. Suddenly, we became the movie of the guy and girl running through Times Square asking everyone for directions (because naturally in New York City both Google and Apple maps cannot be trusted). We arrived with a minute to spare, and after catching my breath, I realized how thrilling the city is (even during stressful situations). I did not know anything about King Charles III, but I was blown away with the bold content of the story and the brave portrayals of the Royal Family  I walked away with a desperate urge to research and learn all there was to this play. This post-show feeling was not an anomaly. As the following week progressed, I was mesmerized by Phantom and grief-stricken in Fun Home and The Flick. I was astounded by UT alum Conrad Ricamora   s performance in the current production of The King and I. On another day I watched The Tonight Show where Jimmy Fallon hugged me (and I was even featured on the broadcast), followed by an astonishing performance of Hamilton. This is a revolutionary show that A-list celebrities cannot even get tickets to, yet Dr. Anderson was able to find a source who could get all twenty of us tickets with great seats, too. Within minutes of the show starting, we quickly understood what all the hype was about. After nearly every Broadway show I saw, an even deeper passion for theatre than I ever thought possible ignited within me. I was originally worried that going to New York City for the first time for a class might restrict my experiences, but I could not have been more wrong. This course opened my eyes to what felt like an entirely different planet, and I feel privileged I could venture on this journey with such incredible peers, too. Now that I have had a chance to reflect on the trip and the city, I have a feeling I   ll be back for good someday to make my life and make my way, but for today I   ll remember and enjoy these incredible memories. As a future educator, I feel blessed to have this opportunity and cannot wait to one day bring back what I learned to the classroom.","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/in-our-own-words-clay-jeffries-discusses-english-492-drama-in-new-york\/"},{"title":"Christopher Hebert&#8217;s Novel Angels of Detroit Published","content":"Christopher Hebert&#8217 s Novel Angels of Detroit Published Christopher Hebert s second novel,  Angels of Detroit,  was published by Bloomsbury Press on July 5, 2016. Once an example of American industrial might, Detroit has gone bankrupt, its streets dark, its storefronts vacant. Miles of city blocks lie empty, saplings growing through the cracked foundations of abandoned buildings. In razor-sharp, beguiling prose,  Angels of Detroit  draws us into the lives of multiple characters struggling to define their futures in this desolate landscape  a scrappy group of activists trying to save the city with placards and protests  a curious child who knows the blighted city as her own personal playground  an elderly great-grandmother eking out a community garden in an oil-soaked patch of dirt  a carpenter with an explosive idea of how to give the city a new start  a confused idealist who has stumbled into debt to a human trafficker  a weary corporate executive who believes she is doing right by the city she remembers at its prime-each of their desires is distinct, and their visions for a better city are on a collision course. In this propulsive, masterfully plotted epic, an urban wasteland whose history is plagued with riots and unrest is reimagined as an ambiguous new frontier-a site of tenacity and possible hope. Driven by struggle and suspense, and shot through with a startling empathy, Christopher Hebert s magnificent second novel unspools an American story for our time. Reviews     Ambitious, well-paced, observant   Angels of Detroit  is a first-rate novel of flawed but admirable characters who want a brighter future.              Shelf Awareness    A powerful and evocative ensemble novel.              Largehearted Boy    Hebert   s powerful novel will produce chills. . . . Scrambling for viable options, Hebert   s current residents  of Detroit    activists, planners, takers, opportunists, and optimists still living in a city that looks war-gutted   are undertaking to shake off the shroud of how-did-this-happen and discover renewed vigor. Hebert   s tenacious prose . . . drives the narrative and brings characters . . . to visceral life.        Booklist    A humbler, more endearing bunch of rainbow-hued misfits never fumbled their broken-hearted way towards revolution than those we meet in Christopher Hebert   s  Angels of Detroit   truly a novel of our moment, both in the way it stares unsentimentally at the real trouble we are in   a world of poisoned children and cities in ruins   and in the deep and detailed empathy it shows for characters of every class and provenance.  Hebert gets Detroit right, in this beautifully made book  his careful drawing of its physical catastrophe locates the city at the exact boundary between gritty-real and surreal, between last hope and post-apocalyptic nightmare.            Jaimy Gordon, author of the National Book Award-winning  Lord of Misrule    Set in a city that   s either deteriorating beyond hope or rising from the ashes,  Angels of Detroit  pulls off the magic trick of all great fiction  it makes the world we live in now seem both wondrous and strange.              Adam Ross, author of  Mr. Peanut    Christopher Hebert   s prose is as incantatory as it is precise, summoning forth a city dreamlike in its strangeness but unmistakably grounded in living reality. Few contemporary writers invoke the secret landscapes of American cities this well. An exciting addition to the new canon of brave contemporary novels devoted to our twenty-first century lives, its every page bearing witness to the dark, desperately digging for hope, the work of a fine novelist writing unflinching before all the good and the bad, the ugly and the ultimately beautiful.        Matt Bell, author of  Scrapper    Written in evocative prose with careful detail, this is a veracious portrayal of a decimated city. It moves at an exciting pace, the various plot threads braiding rapidly. Most poignant is the insight offered about those fighting to amend the damage. These characters are flawed and more appealing for it. Perhaps Hebert intends to suggest that this is true of the city itself. An expansive yet intimate tale of the efforts made to save a decaying Detroit.      Kirkus Reviews    Angels of Detroit  is an unforgettable take on one of America   s great urban tragedies. Its ruins are real and devastating, crowded with magnificent characters, shot through with passion, alive with history, drama, and courage. I read this novel urgently, feeling wonder on every page.        Whitney Terrell, author of  The Good Lieutenant    Hebert   s varied and vividly-drawn ensemble cast brings to life a portrait of Detroit so multifaceted that it is, really, an original literary vision of late-capitalist America.

Professor Michael Knight describes the department s excitement  This English department and the Creative Writing Program are thrilled to be adding Chris Hebert to the faculty this fall. Chris has proven himself to be a dedicated teacher and he distinguished himself during the hiring process with his thoughtful presentation and his innovative approaches to classroom practices for students at all levels. After serving as the Jack E. Reese Writer-in-Residence for five years, he knows our program well and should be able to step right into the position without a hitch. This is not to mention that his second novel,  Angels of Detroit, is coming out this summer and already getting outstanding notices. That   s no surprise.  Angels of Detroit  is a sweeping dazzle of a book that manages to remain human and intimate despite its grand scale and ensemble cast. We   re lucky to have such a big talent joining our ranks.   Hebert s recently celebrated the release of his second novel,  Angels of Detroit,  at a reading and reception at Union Ave Books in Knoxville. In razor-sharp, beguiling prose,  Angels of Detroit  draws us into the lives of multiple characters struggling to define their futures in this desolate landscape  a scrappy group of activists trying to save the city with placards and protests  a curious child who knows the blighted city as her own personal playground  an elderly great-grandmother eking out a community garden in an oil-soaked patch of dirt  a carpenter with an explosive idea of how to give the city a new start  a confused idealist who has stumbled into debt to a human trafficker  a weary corporate executive who believes she is doing right by the city she remembers at its prime-each of their desires is distinct, and their visions for a better city are on a collision course. In this propulsive, masterfully plotted epic, an urban wasteland whose history is plagued with riots and unrest is reimagined as an ambiguous new frontier-a site of tenacity and possible hope. Driven by struggle and suspense, and shot through with a startling empathy, Christopher Hebert s magnificent second novel unspools an American story for our time. Hebert s  first novel,  The Boiling Season, was published by Harper Collins in 2012.

His work examines the intersections of rhetoric, digital technologies, and environmental studies. He focuses on innovations at these intersections that have important applications both to the humanistic development of emerging technologies and to the field of technical communication. Morey is the author of Rhetorical Delivery and Digital Technologies  Networks, Affect, Electracy   (Routledge 2015), in which he examines how the rhetorical canon of delivery is changing against the backdrop of emerging digital technologies. As Indiana University   s Scot Barnett has described,    Like delivery itself, Sean Morey   s book offers more than it suggests at first glance. Beneath its insightful readings of delivery hyprokrisis in the classical tradition and its examinations of delivery   s many meanings and possibilities in new media contexts, it delivers something else as well  a new style of reading and writing   indeed, a new method for rhetorical inquiry   specifically attuned to the medial logics of the digital age.    Morey has applied his theoretical investigations toward pedagogy by developing two textbooks. These textbooks, which focus on writing instruction that uses digital technologies, are The New Media Writer   published by Fountainhead Press in 2014   and The Digital Writer, forthcoming this fall, also by Fountainhead. Both books challenge students to be not only consumers of digital media, but also producers of digital writing. These books also encourage students to develop projects that engage and serve their local communities, pushing writing instruction beyond the classroom. In addition to these works, Morey has co-edited the collection Ecosee  Image, Rhetoric, Nature, with Sidney I. Dobrin (SUNY Press 2009), and is now co-editing a forthcoming collection, Augmented Reality  Perspectives Across Art, Industry, and Academia (with John Tinnell). This latter collection delves into Morey   s recent focus on the emerging technologies of mixed media, particularly augmented reality. The collection investigates how augmented reality as an emerging writing technology currently affects   and may affect in the future   human interactions with networked spaces, digital culture, and engagement with texts. Morey is also working on his second monograph, A Network of Bones  Imagining Key West and the Florida Keys (Texas A&M University Press). This book combines his research in digital technologies with environmental rhetorics to question how this intersection might provide new, productive ways to reimagine environmental conversations and debates. The book situates Morey   s hometown of Key West, FL and the geographical environment of the Florida Keys as a network of identities that circulate particular moods of the Keys through the region   s various images and icons. The book is grounded in theories of how digital networks affect conceptions and experiences of space. It works toward a larger goal of reimagining rhetorics of conservation and sustainability that apply not just to the Keys, but to the affective networks of any environment. Dr. Morey   s projects are on the cutting edge of research in rhetoric, technical communication, and digital technologies. What   s more, he is a skilled and avid fisherman, and he can fix an outboard motor as easily as he can a comma splice. What a wonderful new addition to our department!

I am thrilled and proud to have Joy Harjo as a colleague,    Marilyn Kallet said.    I have admired her and her poetry ever since I reviewed In Mad Love and War in 1990. I learned that Joy Harjo started out as a visual artist  one can sense the love of design in everything she writes. In her lines there   s a fierce connectedness to the natural world and to all living beings that we urban dwellers often lose sight of. This connectedness fuels her writings on social justice, on tribal life, and charges up her love poetry. Truly, Joy Harjo is one of the great love poets of our time. Her poems are electric, shot with lightning and storms, harnessed by the skilled seer.    Harjo was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma and is an enrolled and active member of the Mvskoke Nation, with maternal ties to the Cherokee Nation. She earned her BA from the University of New Mexico and MFA from the Iowa Writers    Workshop. She is the author of nine books of poetry, a memoir, Crazy Brave, which won the American Book Award and the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Award, as well as many other works. Her most recent book of poems, Conflict Resolution with Holy Beings, W.W. Norton, 2015, won the Wallace Stevens Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Academy of American Poets. A few of her many other honors include a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Native Writers Circle of the Americas, the William Carlos Williams Award from the Poetry Society of America, and the New Mexico Governor   s Award for Excellence in the Arts. For A Girl Becoming, a young adult coming of age book, was released in 2009. Currently she is serving as a judge for the 2015 National Book Award in poetry. Harjo is currently working on a play, Wings of Night Sky, Wings of Morning Light, forthcoming from Wesleyan University Press, and Song Lines of Justice, a historical memoir, for W.W. Norton. Her musical play, We Were There When Jazz Was Born, has been commissioned by the New York Public Theater. Joy Harjo has released five award-winning CD   s of original music and in 2009 won a Native American Music Award for Best Female Artist of the Year for Winding Through the Milky Way. Her most recent CD release is a traditional flute album  Red Dreams, A Trail Beyond Tears. She performs nationally and internationally with her band, the Arrow Dynamics. She is a founding board member of the Native Arts and Cultures Foundation and writes a column,    Comings and Goings,    for her tribal newspaper, the Muscogee Nation News. Joy Harjo brings to the Creative Writing Program and to the University of Tennessee her distinction as a major figure in contemporary American poetry, her expertise in Native American studies, and her background in creative non-fiction, drama, and music. Her service to the community is as extensive as her publications. We are pleased to welcome her.

The concept of time in the post-millennial age is undergoing a radical rethinking within the humanities.  Time  A Vocabulary of the Present  newly theorizes our experiences of time in relation to developments in post-1945 cultural theory and arts practices. Wide ranging and theoretically provocative, the volume introduces readers to cutting-edge temporal conceptualizations and investigates what exactly constitutes the scope of time studies. Featuring twenty essays that reveal what we talk about when we talk about time today, especially in the areas of history, measurement, and culture, each essay pairs two keywords to explore the tension and nuances between them, from    past future    and      anticipation unexpected    to    extinction adaptation    and    serial simultaneous.    Moving beyond the truisms of postmodernism, the collection newly theorizes the meanings of temporality in relationship to aesthetic, cultural, technological, and economic developments in the postwar period. This book thus assumes that time   not space, as the postmoderns had it   is central to the contemporary period, and that through it we can come to terms with what contemporaneity can be for human beings caught up in the historical present. In the end,  Time  reveals that the present is a cultural matrix in which overlapping temporalities condition and compete for our attention. Thus each pair of terms presents two temporalities, yielding a generative account of the time, or times, in which we live. Dr. Elias is also the author of  Sublime Desire  History and Post-1960 s Fiction  (2001) and co-editor of  The Planetary Turn   Relationally and Geoaesthetics in the 21st Century (2015).   She is the founding president of A.S.A.P.    The Association for the Study of the Arts of the Present. REVIEWS     Arriving at a moment in which there is a need for new frameworks around temporality, historicity, and memory,  Time  offers a rich and beautiful mapping of the concept of    time,    showing where we have come from in our thinking, but more importantly, where we are headed.

These professional development workshops provide new teachers with an introduction to our program. For returning graduate teaching associates and lecturers, the workshops provide a chance to renew and share information, as well as to learn about innovative approaches to teaching writing. Dr. Lynch will lead  a workshop, Lectio Pedagogica,  from 9 00-11 00am, in 1210 McClung Tower,   This  workshop will present a contemplative method for   interpreting the experience of teaching. Workshop participants will not only    read    pedagogical situations, but also experience them.   Experience, John Dewey writes, is    the result, the sign, and the reward    of our interaction with  he world. It refers not only to what happens, but to how we make sense of what happens. It is  never simply    raw    or    cooked,    but is being continually reprocessed. This fluidity presents  challenges for making a resource of experience, particularly in the classroom, where the data are  overwhelmingly complex. From 11 15-12 15, Dr. Lynch will give the keynote address,   After (Pedagogy) Failure,  in 1210 McClung Tower.   Recently, composition has begun to re-imagine failure as a normal (if difficult) part of student writing. But as John Schilb notes, teachers are less inclined to welcome our own failures so warmly. Even less do we have language for deeper failure   the sense, described by Paul Kameen   that an entire pedagogical approach no longer functions. Kenneth Burke insists that when we experience failure, we can nevertheless    win in defeat by charging it off to experience.    This presentation will consider pedagogy failure that seems too large to be so easily written off. Professor Lynch   is an associate professor of English at Saint Louis University, where he directs the writing program. He is the author of After Pedagogy  The Experience of Teaching and the co-editor with Nathaniel Rivers of Thinking with Bruno Latour in Rhetoric and Composition.

This year s Life of the Mind book is Dean s  Leaving Orbit  Notes from the Last Days of American Spaceflight.   The event will take place at 5 30pm in Thompson-Boling Arena.   A limited number of tickets are available to  the  general public. These tickets are free and will be available  from the ticket office in Thompson-Boling Arena and at Union Avenue Bookstore, 517 Union Avenue, Knoxville. Kelly   s visit celebrates the Life of the Mind program, part of First-Year Studies 100, a  zero-credit pass-fail class that gives new students their first taste of  college  studies. As part of the 2016   17 program, freshmen are asked to read  Leaving Orbit and  to complete a written response to the book.   They then participate in a Welcome Week discussion session on the book and attend the August 15th event.  Dean and Kelly, who is a UT graduate, are currently collaborating on a book that will explore the future of space travel and tell Kelly   s story about his historic mission.  Endurance  My Year in Space and Our Journey to Mars  is scheduled for publication in November 2017. Dr.  Margaret Lazarus Dean s  Leaving Orbit  Notes from the Last Days of American Spaceflight  was selected as  the 2016-2017 Life of the Mind Book last spring.   Dean s book, which was named one of the  Top Books of 2015  by  New York Times  book reviewer Michiko Kakutani, marks the first time a book by a UTK faculty member has been selected in the fourteen year history of the program.    This is the first time we   ve chosen a book written by one of our own faculty members,    said Jason Mastrogiovanni, director of first-year studies.    Margaret   s book has gotten great reviews and garnered a lot of national attention. And space travel is a hot topic for Volunteers right now with one of our own   UT Space Institute alumnus Scott Kelly   spending this year aboard the International Space Station. There are a lot of exciting programming possibilities on this topic, and we look forward to seeing what our campus community might come up with.  Jason Mastrogiovanni, Director of First-year Studies (read  more on TN Today) The Winner of the Graywolf Press Nonfiction Prize, Dean s book looks at the waning days of the human spaceflight.  In the 1960s, humans took their first steps away from the earth, and for a time our possibilities in space seemed endless. But in a period of austerity and in the wake of high-profile disasters like  Challenger, that dream has ended. In early 2011, Margaret Lazarus Dean traveled to Cape Canaveral for NASA   s last three space shuttle launches in order to bear witness to the end of an era. With Dean as our guide to Florida   s Space Coast and to the history of NASA,  Leaving Orbit  takes the measure of what American spaceflight has achieved while reckoning with its earlier witnesses like Norman Mailer, Tom Wolfe, and Oriana Fallaci. Along the way Dean meets NASA workers, astronauts, and space fans, gathering possible answers to the question  what does it mean that a spacefaring nation won   t be going to space anymore? The New York Times Book Review  praised  the book as   a joy to read. . . .  Dean  describes her experiences in superb prose that is perhaps the next best thing to being there.    Lynn Sherr, author of  Sally Ride  America   s First Woman in Space,  describes  Leaving Orbit  as  an  eloquent farewell to NASA   s space shuttle program  that  celebrates the extraordinary optimism that lifted humans off the Earth, dreaming of worlds far beyond.  Dr. Margaret Lazarus Dean s first book,  The Time it Takes to Fall, is a novel set near Cape Canaveral that  follows a fictional NASA family through the aftermath of the  Challenger  disaster.","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/professor-deans-leaving-orbit-notes-from-the-last-days-of-american-spaceflight-selected-2016-life-of-the-mind-book\/"},{"title":"Sean Morey&#8217;s Rhetorical Delivery and Digital Technologies Published by Routledge Press","content":"Sean Morey&#8217 s Rhetorical Delivery and Digital Technologies Published by Routledge Press In November of 2015, Sean Morey s  Rhetorical Delivery and Digital Technologies was published by Routledge Press. Morey s  book theorizes digital logics and applications for the rhetorical canon of delivery. Digital writing technologies invite a re-evaluation about what delivery can offer to rhetorical studies and writing practices. Sean Moreyargues that what delivery provides is access to the unspeakable, unconscious elements of rhetoric, not primarily through emotion or feeling as is usually offered by previous studies, but affect, a domain of sensation implicit in the (overlooked) original Greek term for delivery,  hypokrisis. Moreover, the primary means for delivering affect is both the logic and technology of a network, construed as modern, digital networks, but also networks of associations between humans and nonhuman objects. Casting delivery in this light offers new rhetorical trajectories that promote its incorporation into digital networked-bodies. Given its provocative and broad reframing of delivery, this book provides original, robust ways to understand rhetorical delivery not only through a lens of digital writing technologies, but all historical means of enacting delivery, offering implications that will ultimately affect how scholars of rhetoric will come to view not only the other canons of rhetoric, but rhetoric as a whole.  Like delivery itself, Sean Morey   s book offers more than it suggests at first glance.

Her talk is entitled    Teaching Genre Awareness in First-Year Writing     It   s Complicated and Nuanced, and It Takes a Lot of Time        and will take place from 3 30 to 5 00pm, in McClung 1210-11. Genre has been considered to be    a major concern in composition scholarship    (Fulkerson 674) for over a decade now. Noting the centrality of genre to academic writing, numerous writing scholars have argued for genre-based instruction that raises students    genre awareness, developing their rhetorical flexibility in writing within and across the university curriculum. Despite the theoretical appeal of such an approach, though, it remains challenging to implement within the institutional realities of first-year writing. This talk shares the perspectives of new and experienced composition instructors implementing a genre approach over two semesters of teaching. Tardy will highlight some of the challenges and rewards that the teachers experienced and consider the implications of their perspectives for writing program teacher preparation and curriculum development. Christine Tardy is an Associate Professor of English Applied Linguistics at the University of Arizona, where she also serves as the Writing Program   s Director of Second Language Writing. She has published widely in areas such as second language writing, genre theory and pedagogy, disciplinary writing, and policies and politics of English. Her recent books include Beyond Convention  Genre Innovation in Academic Writing (University of Michigan Press, 2015) and Ethnographic Perspectives on Academic Writing (Oxford University Press, 2015, co-authored with Brian Paltridge and Sue Starfield). She has also co-edited the Journal of Second Language Writing since 2011.","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/4528-2\/"},{"title":"The Literature, Criticism, and Textual Studies Speaker Series Presents a Lecture by Heather Love","content":"The Literature, Criticism, and Textual Studies Speaker Series Presents a Lecture by Heather Love The Literature, Criticism, and Textual Studies Speaker Series is pleased to present a lecture by Heather Love, Associate Professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania, on Thursday, October 13, at 3 30pm, in 1210 McClung Tower. In her talk,  Rebuilding the Argo  A Queer Marriage Plot,  Professor Love reads Maggie Nelson   s 2015 The Argonauts in order to reflect on the possibilities for queer narrative after the legalization of same-sex marriage in the U.S. Reflecting on recent debates about anti-normativity in queer studies, she takes up Nelson   s memoir about her marriage to the transgender artist Harry Dodge. In order to imagine a queer marriage plot   one that resists the stark binaries of normative and non-normative   Nelson brings to bear the representational resources of a queer tradition of impossible love as well as a feminist tradition of critical engagement with domesticity, reproduction, and the everyday.

On Wednesday, 10 12, from 4 00-5 30pm, in Art & Architecture Room 111, Dr. Justin Hodgins will give a talk entitled    Contours and Implications of the New Aesthetic.    The New Aesthetic, a term coined by James Bridle, refers to the blending of our virtual and physical worlds. In his talk, Professor Hodgson will focus on the New Aesthetic as not only a collection of postdigital artifacts, but also as an awareness aesthetic. He will show how the New Aesthetic calls attention to the postdigital tendencies in our relationships with our technologies, our acts of mediation, the systems and protocols for producing particular computational representation, and the human viewpoints that frame those considerations. Finally, he will trace the contours of a New Aesthetic and use them as a guide to the rhetorical practices of working creatives in a digitally-saturated culture. Dr. Hodgson is an assistant professor of digital rhetoric in the Department of English at Indiana University Bloomington. He is the founding editor of The Journal for Undergraduate Multimedia Projects (TheJUMP), co-coordinator of the Indiana Digital Rhetoric Symposium, and a graduate of the Rhetorics, Communication, and Information Design doctoral program at Clemson University.

Grounded in qualitative research and concerned equally with theory and practice, the book explores how multilingual students exercise agency in their placement decisions and how student agency can inform the overall programmatic placement of multilingual students into first-year composition courses.

The following is an abstract of her talk  The finished coquettes of the Regency period were remarkable for their tendency to berate themselves for their unseemly and immodest behavior, to curse their faulty education which ignited flirtatious desires without teaching the essential lessons of self-discipline, and to vow reformation     after this  one,  last erotic conquest.  But while these earlier coquettes might have fretted and regretted their behavior through the voluminous pages of their stories, there was a new coquettish heroine about to take their place, and she would have no such torturous self-doubts. This was a new breed of coquette, soon to be nominated the    Flirt    in order to make a distinction between the angst-ridden behavior of her ancestral sisters, and a new species of woman who, far from regretting her coquettish tendencies, revels in her    natural    powers of seduction. This coquette, we are assured, is not a creature of her environment, but rather of evolution and biological necessity. By the late nineteenth-century the flirt has come into her own as the    natural    representative of feminine perfection. The wit of an eighteenth-century   s Lady Susan     a woman who charms with her brilliant conversation     has been replaced by the dimpled, blushing perfections of a Cynthia Kirkpatrick or a Rosamund Vincy. What this talk will show is how, by the Victorian period, the flirtatious    word    has become flesh. Ghislaine McDayter is a Professor of English at Bucknell University and author of  Byromania  Byron and the Birth of Celebrity Culture. She is currently finishing a book length project on 18th and 19th century flirtation and feminism entitled,  Licentious Tyrants  Feminism and Flirtation in 18th and 19th Century British Literature,  and serving as one of 5 editors on a new digital edition of Byron   s  Manfred  under the direction of Jerome McGann.

In 2017, Routledge Press published Didactic Novels and British Women s Writing, 1790-1820, a collection of essays, edited by  Hilary Havens.   Tracing the rise of conduct literature and the didactic novel over the course of the eighteenth century, this book explores how British women used the didactic novel genre to engage in political debate during and immediately after the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Although didactic novels were frequently conventional in structure, they provided a venue for women to uphold, to undermine, to interrogate, but most importantly, to write about acceptable social codes and values. The essays discuss the multifaceted ways in which didacticism and women   s writing were connected and demonstrate the reforming potential of this feminine and ostensibly constricting genre. Focusing on works by novelists from Jane West to Susan Ferrier, the collection argues that didactic novels within these decades were particularly feminine  that they were among the few acceptable ways by which women could participate in public political debate  and that they often blurred political and ideological boundaries. The first part addresses both conservative and radical texts of the 1790s to show their shared focus on institutional reform and indebtedness to Mary Wollstonecraft, despite their large ideological range. In the second part, the ideas of Hannah More influence the ways authors after the French revolution often linked the didactic with domestic improvement and national unity. The essays demonstrate the means by which the didactic genre works as a corrective not just on a personal and individual level, but at the political level through its focus on issues such as inheritance, slavery, the roles of women and children, the limits of the novel, and English and Scottish nationalism. This book offers a comprehensive and wide-ranging picture of how women with various ideological and educational foundations were involved in British political discourse during a time of radical partisanship and social change.

Beginning in the twelfth century, clergy and laity alike started wondering with intensity about the historical and developmental details of Jesus  early life. Was the Christ Child like other children, whose characteristics and capabilities depended on their age? Was he sweet and tender, or formidable and powerful? Not finding sufficient information in the Gospels, which are almost completely silent about Jesus  childhood, medieval Christians turned to centuries-old apocryphal texts for answers. In  The Quest for the Christ Child in the Later Middle Ages, Mary Dzon demonstrates how these apocryphal legends fostered a vibrant and creative medieval piety. Popular tales about the Christ Child entertained the laity and at the same time were reviled by some members of the intellectual elite of the church. In either case, such legends, so persistent, left their mark on theological, devotional, and literary texts. The Cistercian abbot Aelred of Rievaulx urged his monastic readers to imitate the Christ Child s development through spiritual growth  Francis of Assisi encouraged his followers to emulate the Christ Child s poverty and rusticity  Thomas Aquinas, for his part, believed that apocryphal stories about the Christ Child would encourage youths to be presumptuous, while Birgitta of Sweden provided pious alternatives in her many Marian revelations. Through close readings of such writings, Dzon explores the continued transmission and appeal of apocryphal legends throughout the Middle Ages and demonstrates the significant impact that the Christ Child had in shaping the medieval religious imagination. Reviews   The Christ Child, like the Man of Sorrows, was a regular presence in later medieval religion, but a complex and seemingly contradictory figure. He could be the subject of tender affective piety, but he could also be the mischievous child of apocryphal infancy narratives, lowly and vulnerable or lordly and powerful, the subject of imaginative narratives or the focus of meditation and prayer. With deeply impressive learning and clarity, Mary Dzon unfolds the complexities of the Christ Child in medieval culture. She gives the subject the careful and captivating attention it has long needed.    Richard Kieckhefer, Northwestern University  The Quest for the Christ Child  in the Later Middle Ages fills a major lacuna in the history of affective piety  the importance of the Christ Child in lay and clerical devotion from the twelfth to the fifteenth century. This book is a timely and novel exploration of terra incognita, with methodological relevance to scholars outside the fields of medieval spirituality.

Dr Sackey will present   on his work as a researcher in environmental rhetorics and advocacy on Thursday at 3 30 p.m. He is an Assistant Professor of Rhetoric and Composition at Wayne State University, and is currently  a co-investigator on a grant funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to perform risk communication work around the lead and legionella contamination crisis in the municipal water system in Flint, MI. An abstract for his talk  entitled  Research Notes from Flint, Michigan    is below  How can advocates, particularly communication researchers, build and maintain alliances across space in pursuit of environmental justice? In  Advocacy After Bhophal, Kim Fortun writes of    double binds    or situations that create    persistent mismatch between explanation and everyday life, which force ethical agents to    dream up    new ways of understanding and engaging the world    (13). Double bind situations become kairotic moments that serve as a means to locate enunciatory communities, and develop rhetorical tools that respond to the specificities of space and time. This presentation reports on university-led public advocacy efforts around the water crisis in Flint. Specifically, I ask what are the definitions of advocacy operating within Flint? And what type of advocacy does Flint demand? Although these seem like similar questions, they point to tensions between privileged bodies (university researchers, local, state, and federal regulatory officials) and powerless constituencies (residents). Advocacy in Flint is situated amidst colliding demands for social, political, and technological change. How advocates utilize, represent, and coordinate attitudes in this complex system define the conditions for perception of justice and what type of change is possible.","link":"http:\/\/english.utk.edu\/the-rhetoric-writing-and-linguistics-speaker-series-presents-a-talk-by-dr-donnie-johnson-sackey\/"},{"title":"Afrofuturism Week is March 27-31 and Features a Reading by Award-Winning Novelist Nnedi Okorafor","content":"Afrofuturism Week is March 27-31 and Features a Reading by Award-Winning Novelist Nnedi Okorafor March 27-31 marks a week of activities about Afrofuturism, a contemporary arts movement connecting the musical, literary, and visual arts and combining elements of science fiction and speculative futurism, history, and fantasy with African and African diasporic cultures and political standpoints.

The mission of Writers in the Library is to    showcase the work of novelists, poets, and other literary craftsmen.    Some of the best voices in contemporary literature are invited to read. Manuel Gonzales is the author of the novel The Regional Office is Under Attack! and the acclaimed story collection    The Miniature Wife,    winner of the American Academy of Arts and Letters Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction and the John Gardner Fiction Book Award. A graduate of the Columbia University Creative Writing Program, he teaches writing at the University of Kentucky and the Institute of American Indian Arts. He has published fiction and nonfiction in Open City, Fence, One Story,  Esquire, McSweeney   s Quarterly Concern, and The Believer. Of Gonzales s most recent book, The New York Times writes,    Gonzales   s prose is crisp, but fittingly looping and parenthetical, often doubling back on itself to offer a slightly different interpretation. The point here seems to be that there is no such thing as a simple story, because all stories are about humans, and no human is  entirely knowable.

We are glad that you are interested in learning more about becoming an English major or minor. Maybe you feel most alive when you are in a creative writing class, reading Shakespeare   s plays or Austen   s novels, or crafting a passionately argued essay. English is a major that turns doing what you love into the key to your future, and it   s a great minor to pair with just about any other major. English trains you as a critical thinker, researcher, and writer, all marketable skills that could take you anywhere. English majors do as well in overall employment stats as math and computer science majors, and better than business majors, according to a Georgetown survey of recent college graduates. We also know that English majors get jobs that can   t be outsourced, jobs based around human interactions, critical thinking, and communication. CEOs like Bracken Darrell of Logitech are pleading for more English majors. Law schools love you all. And the journalism firmament is full of English major stars  Barbara Walters, Grant Tinker, Bob Woodward, and Andrea Mitchell, to name a few. And we win, because, Emma Watson.

The distribution requirements are simple, and you can choose from four different concentrations  Literature  Rhetoric & Writing  Technical Writing  and Creative Writing.    What can I do with it? Our majors succeed in many professions, including law, publishing, medicine, marketing, education, finance, and entrepreneurial ventures because they know how to do research, think critically, and write with clarity and grace.
