Professor Tapas Mallick
Chair in Clean Technologies (Renewable Energy)
Profile
I currently lead solar energy activities within the ESI. My research focus is applied solar energy and, with my research team, I look at bridging the urban and rural energy divide through solar energy implementation. I am particularly interested in teaching advanced solar energy engineering and heat transfer for renewable energy systems.
I am Academic Lead of the Renewable Energy group in the College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences.
You can find out more by watching a two-minute video of me explaining my work.
