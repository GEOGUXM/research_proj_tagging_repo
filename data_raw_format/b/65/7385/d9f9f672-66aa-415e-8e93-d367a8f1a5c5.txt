Glenn Wilcox is Associate Professor of Architecture at Taubman College of Architecture at the University of Michigan, where he held the Muschenheim Fellowship in 1999-2000. He has a B.Arch from Temple University and an M.Arch from Cornell University. He teaches courses in architectural design, generative design computing, and digital fabrication. He previously taught at Cornell University and the University of Oregon. His research agenda focuses on the production of architecture as a technological and cultural artifact, with a specific interest in leveraging the power of computationally-based design and numerically-controlled machines towards new methodologies, materials, and systems of production.
Wilcox established his firm area.architecture with Anca Trandafirescu in 2003. The practice explores a breadth of design issues through competitions, commissioned projects, furniture fabrication, and design/build work, installations and less categorical investigations. The firms recognitions include: a citation award in Architecture Magazines R+D Awards for their carbon fiber research project c-Lith (2014); a special mention in Architizers A+ Awards for the Flying Carpet project (2014); the same project also received a Huron Valley AIA award (2013); an honorable mention ACSA Faculty Design Award for Hot Air (2010); an honorable mention in the 99K House Competition (2008); a design merit award in the Decatur Modern House Competition (2007); third prize in the St. Louis Folly Competition (2007); an AIA merit award for their design/build house renovation in Eugene, Oregon (2005); second prize in the Urban Reserve House Competition (2005), and finalist in the Chicago Prize International Design Competition (2003).
