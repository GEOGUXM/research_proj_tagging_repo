WELCOME!
We care about your eye care and we care about you.
We provide easy access by phone, fax, or in person to our support Staff and our Optometrists and Surgeons. We provide excellent care for pediatric, general, optometric, plastic and reconstructive, glaucoma, health maintenance and advanced surgical care for all ages.
We keep waiting times low and we answer all your questions. Bilingual services in French and English are guaranteed, and some of our doctors speak other languages, including Italian, Hebrew, Russian, Spanish, and Greek and are training to speak more languages to better accommodate your needs.
Our equipment is state-of-the-art and our rooms and equipment are cleaned daily, regularly maintained, and calibrated. We measure and analyze patient outcomes and satisfaction continuously to ensure that the results you achieve are far better than the best of accepted standards.
We aim for the ideal in the services we provide for you, even if it means developing new methods and techniques. In fact, some of our glaucoma patients have seen their vision re-expand after treatment under our care. Dr. Cohen has developed new and revolutionary methods, that you are welcome to see for yourself in our videos section.
Our Surgeons are McGill University teachers and researchers and the Drummond Eye Clinic is a certified affiliate of McGill. Through their numerous active and unique local, Provincial and National leadership roles and Society memberships, Dr. Cohen and Dr. Kavalec actively ensure that patient interests are best served and that the highest of standards are met or exceeded.
This website is for you. We encourage you to learn and take an active role in your eye care and we will support you in every way we can.
Welcome to Montreal's site dedicated to excellence in surgical, medical and optometric eye care.
