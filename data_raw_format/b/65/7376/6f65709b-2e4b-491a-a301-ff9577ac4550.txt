Paul Vanouse is a new media artist and an Associate Professor of Visual Studies and co-director of Emerging Practices MFA program at the University of Buffalo.   His artworks include data collection devices that examine polling and categorization, genetic experiments, and temporary organizations that performatively critique institutionalization and corporatization. These “Operational Fictions” are hybrid entities — simultaneously functional machines and fanciful representations — intended to resonate in the equally hyper-real context of the contemporary electronic landscape.
