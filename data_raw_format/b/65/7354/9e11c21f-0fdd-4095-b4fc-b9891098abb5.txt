About
Roozbeh's research will focus on quantifying the flood risks and performing a flood damage assessment (direct and indirect; in the flooded area) for a case study area within Australia. With this knowledge, mitigation of the risks could occur for the future flood scenarios. Should a flood actually happen, initial response could be based on the estimations of the consequences, which can be updated in real time if the information was available. 
The outcome of this research will be important for disaster management decision-makers as it will provide them with a tool for assisting the development and implementation of an appropriate policy for flood risk mitigation pre-disaster.
