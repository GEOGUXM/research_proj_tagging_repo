Bio
Tyson Ikeda, MD, is a board-certified family medicine doctor and clinical service chief of Family Medicine at UC San Diego Health. He provides primary care for patients of all ages, including preventive care and treatment of acute and chronic diseases.

Dr. Ikeda has been instrumental in establishing UC San Diego’s “patient centered medical home" approach to primary care services. This approach enables doctors to work with patients more closely on preventive care measures and chronic disease management.

Dr. Ikeda is also a staff physician for the California Smokers’ Helpline (1-800-NO-BUTTS) and a site physician champion for the University of California Wide Tobacco Cessation Network.

Personal Statement
Dr. Ikeda says, “The most important thing to me is the long-term relationships we create with patients and their families — from cradle to end of life — that are based on trust, understanding the patient's needs and educating them to make the best informed decision possible about their health care."

As a clinical professor of Family Medicine and Public Health, Dr. Ikeda is involved in training medical students, residents and fellows at UC San Diego School of Medicine.

Dr. Ikeda completed his residency training and earned his medical degree at UC San Diego School of Medicine. He earned his undergraduate degree at UC Los Angeles. He is board-certified in family medicine.
