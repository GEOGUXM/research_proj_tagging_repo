Background
After graduating in Translation and Interpreting Studies at Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona, I specialised in Legal Translation (PG at Autonomous University of Barcelona). Then, my enthusiasm for language learning and teaching took me to complete an MA by Research in the Teaching of Spanish as a Foreign Language (University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University).
Before coming to Durham in 2012, I worked as a translator, mainly in the legal field, and taught Spanish in secondary schools across the North East of England, the language centre of the Autonomous University of Barcelona and the University of Sunderland.
