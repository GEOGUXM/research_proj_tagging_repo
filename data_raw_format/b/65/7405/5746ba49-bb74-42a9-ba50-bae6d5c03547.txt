Z. Laura Tabatabai, MD
Research and Clinical Interests
My clinical interests are primarily in fine needle aspiration biopsy and exfoliative cytology and in evaluating patients in the FNA clinic. I am also involved in general surgical and genitourinary pathology. My primary research interests include the areas of cytology and genitourinary pathology. I collaborate with the Department of Urology to investigate epigenetic alterations in cancers of the genitourinary tract and with the Department of Radiology to investigate the role of MR spectroscopic and clinical MR imaging in the detection of prostate and kidney cancers as it relates to diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of disease.
