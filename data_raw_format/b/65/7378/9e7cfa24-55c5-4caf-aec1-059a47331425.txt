Summary
My research interests focus on the intersection of communication theory and health behavior outcomes. I have a background in (a) communication and risky behaviors, with an emphasis on stigma management as antecedent to health behavior outcomes, and (b) stress and coping in chronic illness, with an emphasis on the forms, functions, provision, and effects of social support among both patients and care providers. More recently, I have been working heavily in the arena of sexual communication, covering science on biological, socio-cultural, and mediated variables that affect sexual attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. This work includes the dynamics of social attraction and communication between sexual partners, such as shared decision-making, sexual negotiation, and deception.
