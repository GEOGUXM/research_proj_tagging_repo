Research Projects
The project aims at the reduction of noise produced by ventilation systems with heat exchangers. The noise sources are mechanical vibrations due to the fan, the acoustic pressure generated by the action of the impeller in air and the turbulence of the air in the ducts. In this PDEng project, the objective is to reduce both the noise radiated from the ventilation unit and the noise radiated from the air supply vents.
