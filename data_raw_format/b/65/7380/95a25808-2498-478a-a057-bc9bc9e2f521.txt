Personal details
BA, PhD
I gained my first degree at Durham University and my doctorate at Christ Church, Oxford. I have taught History at several British Universities since the 1980s, and most recently held Lectureships at Luton and then Warwick before I came to Leicester in 2001.
Teaching
Office Hours: Semester 2, Thursday 11am-1pm
Dissertation Office Hour: Tuesday 12pm - 1pm
My teaching interests lie primarily in the history of Britain, France and Ireland in the long eighteenth century, c1680-1820, and I teach a special subject on the French Revolution from the meeting of the Estates-General to the creation of the Napoleonic Empire in 1804. One of my major interests has become British party politics in the reign of that underestimated monarch, Queen Anne (1702-1714), and that that is a new 2nd Year module in 2015-16. Other options offered have included a look at Church and state in eighteenth-century England, French politics in the reign of Louis XV (1715-74), and Jacobitism. I regularly supervise undergraduate dissertations across the full span of early modern history.

Research
Themes
My research over the last 35 years has centred on the history of religion in western Europe during the ‘long- eighteenth century of c.1680-1830 (especially in France and Britain), with a particular focus on the clergy in politics and intellectual life. However, I also have a strong interest in élite politics in the same era, especially the parliamentary role of the British peerage and the life and times of William, 2nd earl of Shelburne (1737-1805). Secondary research areas include eighteenth-century religious art; Anglo-French interactions and exchanges, particularly in religion and politics; court culture and ceremonial; state patronage and the political uses of the honours system. The distinctive character of my work in political and religious history is well known across the United Kingdom, in France and in the United States. It is recognised both by publishing contracts with Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, Palgrave Macmillan and Reaktion Books, and financial awards for study in French and North American archives.
Current projects
I am completing a book provisionally entitled Oxford and the Enlightenment: the University and the cultural life of eighteenth-century Britain. It is a wide-ranging monograph of approximately 140,000 words to be published by Oxford University Press in 2017. My second major project is a research edition of volume two of The Correspondence of James Boswell and William Johnson Temple 1756-1795, part of the Yale Editions of the Private Papers of James Boswell. I am also completing two articles on the eighteenth-century Premier, the earl of Shelburne.
Supervision
Clerical politics (either in France or Britain) during the long eighteenth-century; the Churches' relationship with the Enlightenment; inter-denominational relationships; and the role of royal courts.
