Abstract Dr. Swanson's research focuses on hyperactivity, attention deficit disorder and conduct disorder in children. Through his research, Dr. Swanson has developed procedures for monitoring the cognitive effect of stimulant medication, the most frequent treatment for this group of patients. His research also focuses on biochemical and genetic factors related to these disorders.

Dr. Swanson is also investigating the effect of intensive, early intervention for children with attention and conduct disorders through a school-based treatment program conducted in cooperation with the Orange County Department of Education. This program is carried out at the Child Development Center. In addition, he is evaluating the risk and protective factors for anti-social behavior of hyperactive children as they mature.
