Pediatric Neurology
My principal area of clinical research has centered on epilepsy, use of EEG and video EEG-monitoring in diagnosis and studies of efficacy and side effects of new anti-epileptic medications. Other clinical research projects have included studying the natural history and neuroradiologic correlation of strokes in children and treatment of the disorders in children.
