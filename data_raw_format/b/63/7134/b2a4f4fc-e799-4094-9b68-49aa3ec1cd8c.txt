Tianna Paschel
Assistant Professor
Tianna Paschel is an assistant professor of African American Studies dept. at the University of California. She is interested in the intersection of racial ideology, politics, and globalization in Latin America. Her work can be found in the American Journal of Sociology, the Du Bois Review, SOULS: A Critical Journal of Black Politics, Culture and Society, and Ethnic and Racial Studies, various edited volumes as well as in two forthcoming books. The first—Becoming Black Political Subjects– draws on ethnographic and archival methods to explore the shift in the 1990s from ideas of unmarked universal citizenship to multicultural citizenship regimes and the recognition of specific rights for black populations by Latin American states. The second is an interdisciplinary volume - Afro-Latinos in Movement co-edited with Petra Rivera-Rideau and Jennifer Jones – that explores transnationalism and blackness in the Americas.
 
Tianna is also a Ford Fellow and member of the American Political Science Association Task Force on Race and Class Inequality as well as the Steering Committee of the Network of Anti-Racist Action and Research.
