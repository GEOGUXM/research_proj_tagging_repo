I study the Middle Ages in western Europe with side interests in Byzantine and Islamic history. I am primarily interested in the history of Christianity before the Protestant Reformation, especially the Christian cult of the saints in early medieval French and Belgian Flanders. My current book project, The Virtues of Memory: Saint Winnoc in Early Medieval Flanders, 700-1100, examines the roles that collective memories about saints played in establishing and maintaining group identities. Before arriving at K-State, I earned my Ph.D. at Ohio State University, spent a year researching at the Pontifical Institute for Mediaeval Studies in Toronto and taught at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
I plan to teach History 101: The Rise of Europe and History 567: Europe in the Middle Ages almost every fall semester, and upper-level undergraduate courses in the spring semesters.
