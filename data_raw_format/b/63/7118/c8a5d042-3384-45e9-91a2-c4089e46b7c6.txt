Academic Interests
Solid state physics and chemistry including synthesis and characterization of materials for energy storage. Structure characterization via in-situ synchrotron radiation and powder neutron diffraction performed at large scale facilities, for instance at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) of Grenoble (France), at the Canadian Institute for Neutron Scattering (CINS) of Chalk River (Canada) and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), USA. Investigation of nanoscale and porous materials with small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS and SAXS).
