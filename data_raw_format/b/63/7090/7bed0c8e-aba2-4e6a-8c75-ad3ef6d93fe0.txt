Cynthia E. Sellinger
Courtesy Assistant Professor
I am researching the effect that climate change has on Pacific salmon.  Specifically, I statistically analyze how major climatic events (El Nino and La Nina) affect the respectively nutrient-rich and nutrient- poor oceanographic episodes (upwelling and downwelling).

Research
Hydrology, predictive modeling of the physical and biological characteristics of the watershed , coastal, and deep ocean ecosystems; specifically: 1) predicting water levels of the Great Lakes by statistically characterizing the hydrologic cycle; 2) forecasting beach closures by developing data- intensive watershed models; 3) applying the hydrological cycle to quantify the amount of the groundwater contributing to the Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea; 4) developing spatially explicit representations of ecosystem environments with remotely-sensed data; 5) modeling underwater acoustic data in support of studies on patchiness, stock abundance, and community size structure in pelagic ecosystems; and, 6) researching the impacts of coastal hypoxia and other physical processes on fish.

Outreach and Extension
2006 – 2009—worked closely with students from the University of Michigan’s Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program.  Gave presentations to underrepresented students about careers in the fields of hydrology and oceanography; and provided tours and of the NOAA facility and one-on-one conversations with other scientist at the laboratory.
2008—mentored an undergraduate student for the Center for Excellence for Great Lakes Habitat Restoration.  Instructed him on policies, science and database construction for the Center.  Additionally, introduced him to the restoration community by having him attend meetings and file reports.
2007—gave over 81 interviews with newspaper, radio, and television stations both nationally and internationally on water level fluctuations.
2006-- Gave over 10 Interviews with newspaper and radio on Great Lakes water levels.
2002—CNN Interview on water levels.
Winter 1999—Mentored minority students for the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography.
Summer 1996 --Trained and supervised a Partners for Excellence high-school student in the computer, data analysis area.  
1994 - 1997 -- Participated as a panelist for the University of Michigan Undergraduate Research Program for Women.  In this capacity, I gave presentations about GLERL and my career as a minority and woman scientist.
