About
Laura Beth Bugg is an Assistant Professor for the Study of Religion. She received her doctorate from the Harvard Divinity School in 2006. Her primary research interests are at the intersection of religion, place and welfare governance. She is particularly interested in the experiences of new immigrant groups in the establishment of places of worship and religious schools, and the ways in which contestations around minority places of worship and schools are mediated and controlled by local governance processes.
