SUMMARY
HEAD OF DIVISION OF COMPUTATIONAL AND SYSTEMS MEDICINE
RESEARCH INTERESTS:
Prof. Holmes is the Head of the Division of Computational and Systems Medicine and a Professor of Chemical Biology in the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College, in London, UK.  She has over 20 years experience in metabonomic technology and its applications.  Her focus is on the discovery and development of metabolic biomarkers of disease in personalised healthcare and population studies with significant contributions to cardiovascular, neuroscience and infectious disease research.  Recently Prof. Holmes has driven large-scale profiling efforts defining the concept of the metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) in molecular epidemiology, specifically exploring the link between hypertension, diet and metabolic profiles.  She has also developed methods for characterizing gut microbiome host metabolic interactions and has applied these to the study of gastrointestinal related diseases including colorectal cancer, obesity and IBD. She also has an established track record in the development of chemometric and statistical methods for analysis of Omics data. Specific research focus areas:
Application of metabolic profiling technologies to systems biology and translational medicine problems
Development of statistical spectroscopy and other data processing methods for discovery and development of metabolic biomarkers for disease
Development and application of data integration strategies for co-analysis of complex multidimensional datasets
Development of methods for characterizing metabolic interactions between the gut microbiome and host, with application to assessing the role of microbiome in health and disease.
Metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) in molecular epidemiology, specifically exploring the link between hypertension, diet and metabolic profiles.
