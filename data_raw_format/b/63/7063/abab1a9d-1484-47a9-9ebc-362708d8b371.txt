  Degrees
Ph.D. Molecular Microbiology - 1998
University of Nebraska-Lincoln
Bio
Dr. Wen received his PhD in Molecular Microbiology from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, NE in May 1998. He worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Rochester Center for Oral Biology, Rochester, New York from 1998 to 2001 and as a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Oral Biology at the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida from 2001 to 2008.  Dr. Wen joined the faculty at LSU Health Sciences Center in May 26, 2008 as an Assistant Professor with a primary appointment in the Department of Oral and Craniofacial Biology.
Research Interests
The focus of Dr. Wen’s research is on molecular characterization of oral biofilms and identification of novel strategies against human dental caries. Major efforts are directed towards (i) identification of genes required for biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans, the key etiological agent of human dental caries, (ii) characterization of bacterial cell-cell communication and its impact on S. mutans establishment and persistence on the tooth surface, and (iii) identification of natural compounds that are effective against cariogenic biofilms. In addition, Dr. Wen also works with the Xu Group in biomaterial sciences on development of novel antibacterial dental composites.
With the support of NIH/NIDCR, we have recently shown that biofilm regulatory protein BrpA in S. mutans is a surface-associated protein with crucial roles in cell envelope biogenesis, stress tolerance response and biofilm formation, traits critical to pathogenicity of this bacterium. Current efforts in this area are centered on regulation of BrpA expression by transposon mutagenesis and PCR-based techniques, identification of proteins that interact with BrpA by using yeast-two-hybrid system, and identification of small molecules that modulate BrpA-mediated virulence. In a collaborative effort, a systems biology approach that integrates transcriptomics and metabolomics with a multiple-species consortium is also being used to elucidate interactions between S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, a commensal bacterium, and Lactobacillus casei, the bacterium first implicated in caries formation, and the impact of community composition and environmental conditions on gene transcription profiles and cariogenicity.
