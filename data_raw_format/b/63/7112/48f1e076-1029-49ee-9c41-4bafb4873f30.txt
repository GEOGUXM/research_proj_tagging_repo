      Research
Our research is interdisciplinary. We develop and utilize liquid-chromatography and mass-spectrometry based proteomics tools to study cell-surface N-glycoproteins which play important roles in stem-cell development. Through various model systems, we want to understand how extra-cellular microenvironment influences stem-cell function and behavior through these proteins and their N-glycosylation pattern.
Lab members are formed from a group of pasionated and highly motivated graduate and undergraduate students coming from different disciplines including chemistry, biochemistry, molecular and cellular biology, engineering and computer science.
We are looking for enthusiatic students to join our program.
