    Panos Y. Papalambros is the James B. Angell Distinguished University Professor and the Donald C. Graham Professor of Engineering. He is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Professor of Architecture, and Professor of Art and Design; and serves as the founding Chair of the Integrative Systems & Design Division, College of Engineering, at the University of Michigan.
Born in Patras, Greece, he attended the National Technical University of Athens (Ethnikon Metsovion Polytechnion) and earned a diploma in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering in 1974. Moving to California he attended Stanford University and earned his M.S. degree (Mechanical Engineering) in 1976 and Ph.D. degree (Design Division, Mechanical Engineering) in 1979. At Michigan he has served as a faculty member since 1979.
During his tenure at Michigan he served as mechanical engineering department chair (1992-98, and 2007-08) and was the founding director of several laboratories and centers: Optimal Design (ODE) Laboratory (1980-); Design Laboratory (1990-92); Ford Durability Simulation Center (1992-94); Automotive Research Center (1994-2003); General Motors Collaborative Research Laboratory (1998-2002); the Antilium Project (2003-2008), and the Ford BlockM Sustainability Laboratory (2006-2009); he served as the founding chair and director of the University of Michigan interdisciplinary Design Science Doctoral Program (2006-2011).
His research interests include design science and optimization, with applications to sustainable design of products, automotive systems, such as hybrid and electric vehicles; design of complex engineered systems; and architectural design. With D. J. Wilde, he co-authored the textbook Principles of Optimal Design: Modeling and Computation (1988, 2000). He has published over 320 articles in journals, conference proceedings, and books.
He is a member of ASME, INFORMS, MOS, SME, SAE, ISSMO, AIAA, AAUP, ASEE, IEEE, INCOSE and serves as Vice President on the Board of Management of the Design Society. He served as Chief Editor of the ASME Journal of Mechanical Design (2008-2012) and as associate editor of the Journal of Mechanisms, Transmissions and Automation in Design, Journal of Global Optimization, Computer-Integrated Engineering, and the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers International Journal. He currently serves on the editorial boards of the journals Artificial Intelligence in Engineering Design and Manufacturing, Engineering Design, Engineering Optimization, Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, Journal of Reliability and Safety and Product Development.
He is a Fellow of ASME and SAE, and the recipient of the ASME Design Automation Award (1998), ASME Machine Design Award (1999), Japan SME Design and Systems Achievement Award (2004), ASME Joel and Ruth Spira Outstanding Design Educator Award (2007), and the Stephen S. Attwood Award (highest engineering honor in the University of Michigan, 2009).
Professor Papalambros examines the foundations of ISD and the benefits its interdisciplinary nature provides to students.
