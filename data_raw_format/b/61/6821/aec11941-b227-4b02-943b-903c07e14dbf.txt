Teresa B. Culver
Associate Professor
Assistant Chair for Undergraduate Programs
My work prepares engineers for careers in the interdisciplinary field of environmental and water resources engineering. My research focuses on the development and use of computational modeling for effective and sustainable water resources management. The challenges that we are addressing include nutrient management for complex watershed-stream-aquifer systems, ecologically sensitive stormwater designs, and integration of public health and livelihood maintenance into reservoir operations.  In addition to developing technical abilities, I encourage students to consider current environmental challenges and to develop effective collaborative skills.
My current teaching responsibilities include:
CE 2100 Introduction to Environmental Engineering
CE 2110 Introduction to Environmental Engineering Lab
CE 4210 Stormwater Management
CE 4110/CE6250 Environmental Systems Modeling and Management
Honors and Awards
School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Civil Engineering Teaching Award (2005)
Walter L. Huber Research Prize, American Society of Civil Engineers (2002)
National Science Foundation CAREER Award (1995-1999)
Lilly Teaching Fellow (1994-1995)
