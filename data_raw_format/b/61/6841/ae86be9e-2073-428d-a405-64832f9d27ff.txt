Research interests
A major focus of our research is to understand the development of the vertebrate hypothalamus. We are aiming to characterise the signalling factor/transcription factor networks that mediate hypothalamic development, elucidate how hypothalamic stem cells progress into defined neuronal cells and how their axons project to different components of the hypothalamus. A second focus is the elucidation of the signalling factor/transcriptional networks that underlie development of the prechordal mesoderm.
