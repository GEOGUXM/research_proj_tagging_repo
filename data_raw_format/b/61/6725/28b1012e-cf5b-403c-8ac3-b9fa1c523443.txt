Research Interests
Ms. Monroe-Cook became a project manager at the Eppley Institute in September 2016. Her previous work primarily focused on programmatic and physical accessibility training, evaluation, and condition assessment in the National Park Service and other federal land management agencies. She worked to provide classroom and web-based instruction, interpretive media design consultation, and technical assistance related to accessibility compliance and program modifications necessary to provide equivalent access and experience to individuals with disabilities in both built and natural environments.

With a Master of Science in Recreation Therapy, Ms. Monroe-Cook brings clinical knowledge and experience of the interaction of persons with disabilities with recreation, parks and public lands entities. Her understanding of the importance of community and family engagement brings a unique perspective to her work. She is especially passionate about consideration and inclusion of persons with disabilities in the park planning process.
