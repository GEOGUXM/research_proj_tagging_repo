Profile Statement: 
My research addresses issues of political ecology of food, diet, and agricultural transitions; food transitions and food sovereignty; environment-economic tensions that emerge in the context of smallholder farmer households; and development and identity. Geographically, I am interested in South Asia and South America (Paraguay). Some of my most recent research includes working with small-scale farmers on issues of food sovereignty, agriculture, and social/physical environmental change in rural Paraguay.
