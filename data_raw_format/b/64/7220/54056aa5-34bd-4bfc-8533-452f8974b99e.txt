Profile Story
James always had a knack for building things from the ground up: forts, telescopes, radios and even darkrooms. He loved being able to see his creations jump from imagination to reality, and his childhood was punctuated by curiosity and the precipitate of chemistry sets—none of which, he assures, resulted in any fires (though "not for lack of trying"). With all that tinkering and toying, it seems James was destined to become an engineer.
James' collegiate aspirations led him to pursue nuclear engineering (among a myriad other subjects), where he, as a young student, endeavored to create the first fusion power plant. "Turns out that's really hard to do," he laughs, grinning at the memory of his own overzealousness. "I can distinctly remember telling one of the faculty on the first day of class, 'I'm here to make a fusion energy plant.' He looked amused and said, 'You might want to think about physics instead of engineering.'"
"I've been at a lot of universities, but there's just something else here. I love this place; it's been over twenty-two years now.  I love everything about this University and this institution."
James Holloway
While the blueprints for his fusion plant might have been shelved, James continued to explore and expand his expertise, eventually discovering a sincere passion for teaching. "I really, really love teaching students. They're amazing people with immense energy and an innovative, collaborative, creative spirit."
In 1990, James joined the faculty of U-M as an assistant professor for Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences. In 2007, he became associate dean for undergraduate education. With the responsibility to meld the hemispheres of industry and impact, he dedicated himself to introducing students not only to the world of engineering but to the world at-large.
James, having spent most of his childhood living in Thailand, became a global citizen at a young age, and he is adamant that all students understand the importance of international community and identity. He has worked dutifully to make sure the College provides ample opportunity for its students to do just that.
"One of the things we're doing is pushing for our students to have authentic experiences where they can take what they've learned in the classroom and really internalize it," he says. "They can use it in a deeply complicated way and reflect on it, so everything from student programs to traveling abroad are ways our students can use what they're learning."
Recently, as a testament to his continued efforts to encourage study abroad and international presence, he was appointed to be the vice provost for global and engaged education. James might be moving away from North Campus, but his ties with the College will last a lifetime.
"There's something about Michigan," he reflects thoughtfully and finally.  "I've been at a lot of universities, but there's just something else here. I love this place; it's been over twenty-two years now.  I love everything about this University and this institution."
