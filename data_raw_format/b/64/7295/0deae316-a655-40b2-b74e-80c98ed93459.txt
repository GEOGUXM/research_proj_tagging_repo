Johannes research focuses on creating a virtual development platform for comminution machines and equipment in the mining and aggregate industry. The computational method discrete element method (DEM) is mainly used for this. Especially crushers and mills are modeled and studied in detail. The goal is to understand and optimize today's machines but also enable the use of virtual prototypes of future machines in early development stages.

A major interest is also product development and design with a focus on how methods and tools can be used in a value-driven creative design and development process.
