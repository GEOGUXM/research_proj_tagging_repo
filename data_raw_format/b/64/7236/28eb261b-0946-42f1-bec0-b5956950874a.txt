Iowa Intensive English Program
Located in Iowa City, Iowa, The University of Iowa Intensive English Program (IIEP) provides intensive English instruction and a cultural, social, and academic orientation to the United States. Instruction emphasizes spoken and written English crucial to college and university study in the U.S. Grammar, writing, reading, listening, comprehension, pronunciation, and conversation skills are taught each day at all levels. Students receive 20 hours of instruction per week in addition to individual work in the language laboratory.
Because class size is small (12â€“15 students per class), each student receives personal attention and encouragement. Our teachers are well-trained and hold advanced degrees in teaching English as a Second Language. All have considerable teaching experience and most have taught outside the United States. Students starting intensive English studies at the beginning level will normally acquire sufficient proficiency to begin academic work after three to four terms in the IIEP. Intermediate students usually require one to two terms, and advanced students normally require one term. The duration of intensive English study required for an individual student varies depending on personal motivation, level of proficiency, and aptitude. At the end of the program, the IIEP issues a Certificate of Attendance to students who have attended class regularly and have received passing grades.
Field trips and cultural activities are an integral part of the Iowa Intensive English Program. In recent years, our students have visited St. Louis, Missouri; the Amana Colonies; a historic village in Kalona, Iowa; a Cedar Rapids Kernels AAA baseball game; and a Halloween corn maze.
The IIEP is authorized to issue I-20s for students applying for F-1 visas. For questions about other visas, please contact the Iowa Intensive English Program at iiep@uiowa.edu. Read more about visa issuance.
Please e-mail us if you have any questions about the Iowa Intensive English Program. We look forward to welcoming you as a student!
