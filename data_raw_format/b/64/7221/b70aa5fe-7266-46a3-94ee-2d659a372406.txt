    Diseases of nonhuman primates
Animal models of obesity and metabolic syndrome
      Research Specialty
    Animal models of human disease 

    Clinical Research Description
    My collaborative research efforts have focused on the investigation of the relationships between risk factors (e.g., stress, obesity, fat distribution pattern, lipid/lipoprotein profiles) and the development of atherosclerosis in nonhuman primate models.
