Dr Z is an excellent doctor but always seems to be running behind due to over scheduling of patients. clinics should be more focused on quality of patient care instead of quantity of patients seen in a day

April 28, 2017
Not much had changed since the laser procedure, but he suggested boosting the number of drops of Asopt to the maximum of 3/day. We'll see if that makes a difference. I think surgery is a big expense if we can try something else.

April 28, 2017
Very good.

April 22, 2017
excellent

April 19, 2017
Great experience

April 13, 2017
Great doctor. I have PhD, so have good understanding of glaucoma, so we could get more technical. Unlike other docs, he was happy to go into details with me.

April 11, 2017
Dr ZABRISKI IS FANTASTIC. i FEEL VERY CONFIDENT IN HIS ADVICE, TREATMENT AND KNOW I WILL GET THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE.

April 08, 2017
the provider is great but it was a 3 min visit with him after waiting 40 mins.

April 07, 2017
Thank you for follow up, care before and after surgery and even follow up phone call. I appreciated the other doctors who assisted as well.

April 01, 2017
I have been seeing Dr. Zabriskie for 17 years. I have the upmost confidence in his ability to treat my condition. He and his staff have always treated me professionally, kindly, helpfully and I have only the best to say about him, and staff at the Moran Eye Center. I have shared my positive opinions and recommended Moran to friends who have a need.

March 29, 2017
Dr. Zabrskie is the best. I would recommend him to anyone who needs eye car

March 27, 2017

March 27, 2017
Dr. Z. recognized my problem immediately and told me what to do to relieve my problem.

March 25, 2017
I have already recommended Dr. Zanriskie to a friend!

March 19, 2017
I am truly grateful for Dr Zabriskie and his entire team. And Dr Jorgensen, one of the fellows soon to leave, has devoted a lot of care to my eye issues with compassion, professionalism and good humor.

March 15, 2017
i feel very safe with them

March 13, 2017
Coming here for eye care is first class.

Dr. Zabriskie is the best ophthalmologist - a professional with technical expertise and knowledge and genuine caring! After my two cataract surgeries (2/13 and 2/27/2017), I had no pains and bruises, and my eyes have improved each day from Day One. Thank you! Dr. Zabriskie's medical and support staff (Dr. Jorgensen, Wilma, C.J., Jill, Susan, Jason, etc.) are excellent and friendly with their medical care and advice. They answered my questions knowledgeably and made me comfortable and relax before and after surgery. Thank you!

March 04, 2017

February 25, 2017
wish Dr. Zabriskie could spend more time with me than the techs.

February 25, 2017
Know this survey is for Dr. Zabriskie, but also want to comment on Dr. Jorgenson who I saw last time. He was very helpful and I appreciated it very much!

February 18, 2017
My confidence in Dr. Zabriskie is off the charts. He is an all star!!!

February 17, 2017
Dr Zabrinski and Dr Mifflin answered many questions and were very helpful. I have been coming to Moran since 2003 and believe attention is being paid to our needs and concerns better than before.

February 10, 2017
wish I had been warned more of possible recovery problems

February 09, 2017

I appreciate having Dr. Zabriskie as my eye doctor and also appreciate his time and care.

January 06, 2017
Dr. Zabrisky is very concerned about his patients.

December 27, 2016
Although when he came in I could tell that it was a very busy day for him, he took the time I needed to answer my questions and to explain my options thoughtfully.

December 23, 2016
All around good experience

December 19, 2016
Dr. Zabriskie continues to be so patient and thorough in all aspects of my on-going glaucoma treatment - I'm so confident that I'm in good hands and trusts him 100%.

December 19, 2016
I also appreciated that the insertion of drops to dilate my eyes was not excessive. This made for less dilation and the ability to even read - which has never happened previously for me. It made recovery and my ability to go about my affairs much easier.

December 16, 2016
I tell everyone I know about the Moran

December 12, 2016
My wife and myself pleased with the treatment she receives at ever level.

December 05, 2016
I feel very fortunate to have Dr. Zabriskie monitoring my glaucoma and appreciate all his care and concerns.

December 04, 2016
I have every confidence that I am getting excellent care

November 28, 2016
Dr. Zabriskie gave me more information about my disease in the 6 - 8 minutes he spent with me than I have ever gotten in the past. I appreciated the information and having my questions and concerns (about cost of eye drops) addressed.

November 21, 2016
thank you for seeing us

November 21, 2016
Dr Z is amazing and kind. He took care of my husband's eyes and now mine. He knows what needs to be done and gets it done. I was traveling soon after my proceeder and he still find a way to fit me into his very busy schedule to check my eyes before my travel.

November 16, 2016
Superb

November 14, 2016
Everyone was very informative and answered questions in depth.

November 07, 2016
Dr Zabrisky is fantastic I trust him completely

November 07, 2016
thanks, I was satisfied

November 05, 2016
good

November 04, 2016
I travel to the Moran eye center because they provide the best care.

October 31, 2016
I appreciate all the time Dr Zabriskie spends with me when I have an appointment. I feel he is spending time trying to decide what the next step is in my eye care. I know this takes extra work on his part to review my chart. I am thankful he is my doctor and I know he will do what is best for my vision.

October 31, 2016
Very skilled in their profession.

October 30, 2016
I feel fortunate to have such an outstanding Dr, as Dr. Zabriskie

October 27, 2016
Excellent provider. I will miss him.

October 22, 2016
Dr Zabriski is very caring and patient and seems to always have time to answer my qustions.

October 20, 2016
I came to the Moran Eye Center as I was losing hope and confused about my treatment path. I had read the Moran Vision statement on their website, but was not expecting too much as it was only a consultation and I am an out of town patient. Dr. Norm Zabriskie completely exceeded my expectations and executed on the vision statement. He ordered only the necessary tests, and gave me an expert diagnosis, and proposed treatment paths for both my eyes. He saw me towards the end of the day, but because my treatment will require frequent monitoring, he reached out to his contacts that evening where I lived and called me back the following morning with who I should contact and consider seeing for my care. The time during the consultation and consideration Dr. Zabriske and Dr. Phillips gave me has given me back hope and direction for my treatment, and made my 1,400 mile visit absolutely more than worthwhile.

October 19, 2016
Praise God for this caring man who happens to be a doctor.

October 17, 2016
Dr. Zabinski is a wonderful doctor and always takes the time.

October 13, 2016
Been with Dr. Zabriskie all my life. Best doctor ever.

October 07, 2016
this whole eye pressure thing has been a bit scary and nerve racking to me. I really appreciate the kindness, acceptance, and concern that has been shown to me. I feel like my concerns are being listened to and addressed. Dr. Zabriskie has been amazing!!! thank you so much for all that you guys do!!!

October 05, 2016
I really liked the care I received

October 04, 2016
all in all a good experience

October 04, 2016
First time I had seen Dr. so limited exposure. Expertise in glaucoma was helpful to know. Am seeing a different doctor next time. He explained that he partners with this other dr who specializes in glaucoma. Good that he explained this.

October 02, 2016
always recommend your services to others

September 29, 2016
Dr. Zabriskie is always considerate and informative. I have asked many questions and have always understood the answers or asked for more info. I would recommend Dr. Z to anyone that needs a wonderful and an ex-ceptionally competent eye specialist, and I have!

September 19, 2016
Dr. Zabriski and staff stayed after quitting time to complete my tests in an emergency situation. Very much appreciated!

September 17, 2016
Spent equal time with Nick, Reeda W. and Dr. Zabriskie. All were excellent as reflected by very good ratings for questions 1-10.

September 12, 2016
Dr. Zebriskie gets a new name Speedy Gonzalous. I like him!!!!

September 07, 2016
Professional and attentive.

August 21, 2016
Dr. Z prescribed an eye drop I had previously used unsuccessfully. I reminded him of this and it was not able to verify it on the chart so prescribed it again. On returning home I checked my prior records and I had used it in January 2016. I am disappointed that my chart evidently does not reflect this fact.

August 21, 2016
When I met with the doctor I was under the impression I would be having one kind of surgery, but was told another procedure was going to be performed as it would be the best for me in his opinion. So, I was a little surprised and knew nothing about the replacement surgery, but since I have every confidence in him, I am going ahead with the surgery he has recommended. He explained a little about what will be done, but I'm sure he didn't want to "scare me off" with too many details, and did allow time for my questions. This is neither a good or a bad experience, just an unexpected one.

August 19, 2016
Everyone was very caring

August 17, 2016
Would not hesitate to recommend the Moran Center

August 16, 2016
I continue to feel so happy and fortunate for the care I receive from Dr. Zabriskie. There needs to be a rating for Excellent in his case.

August 13, 2016
LOVE Dr. Z!

My first visit to Dr. Zabriskie as a patient, although I have been bringing my mom to him for years. Very professional, have confidence in him, explains issues clearly. Lucky to have such an excellent provider available to us.

July 12, 2016
very informative

July 12, 2016
Even though it was getting late and there were patients still to be seen, Dr. Zabriski was not rushed at all. He spent a good amount of time with me, explained things thoroughly, answered all of my questions and talked about possible next steps. This shouldn't have surprised me, as he's always been this way.

July 11, 2016
Dr ZABRISKIE has great " bedside manners:

Have already highly recommended the Moran Eye Cennter.

This was a very up-beat visit. The nurse & doctors were very open, friendly and professional.

April 23, 2016
Excellent

April 15, 2016
I continue to be frustrated with my vision problem. Dr. Zabriskie and the others that see me continue to be patient,caring, and give me support. I appreciate their continuous help.

April 13, 2016
dr. seems to be in a hurry

April 05, 2016
Think the world of Dr. Zabriskie - excellent communicator, caring (about treatment and for you as an individual)

April 04, 2016
Dr. Zabriskie continues to explain my care and medications patiently. I appreciate his care and concern.

March 26, 2016

February 08, 2016
I LOVE Dr. Zabriskie!

February 08, 2016
Moran Eye Center was highly recommended to me by friends. I drive about 600 miles (round trip) for care there. I do that because I have great confidence in the knowledge and care of your staff. I find Dr. Zabriskie to be a humble, caring professional who instills great confidence in his ability.

February 06, 2016
All good

February 01, 2016

January 20, 2016
Took extended time to discuss problem and solution

January 20, 2016
The efficiency of the whole team was amazing

January 16, 2016
Excellent experience, Dr. Zabriskie has been always clear and understandable when explaining my condition and treatment, I feel very confident and I would highly recommend him.

January 16, 2016
He is the greatest?

January 15, 2016
I always recommend Dr. Zabinski and Moran Eye Center services to others.

January 13, 2016
Considering the office was quite busy, Dr. Zabriski took an extra amount of time to talk with me regarding problem and solution. Also stated he would call me before surgery to discuss it further.

December 17, 2015
Good experience

December 14, 2015
I have confidence in the prescribed treatment and those prescribing it.

December 14, 2015
Dr. Zabriskie is a very caring and professional provider. Always friendly and willing to spend time answering any questions.

December 12, 2015
Everyone I talked to seemed knowledgeable

December 10, 2015
The problem is my eyes are bad enough that not much can be done, but Dr. Zabriski did make an appoinement for me with Dr. Christensen to discuss new glasses and other magnifying devices I could use to help with my problem.

December 09, 2015
Understanding how busy the clinic gets, the medical staff always asks if I have any questions prior to the next patient. I appreciate the gesture

November 30, 2015
I have seen Dr Zabriskie for years, and have the highest level of confidence in him, and his care of me.

November 23, 2015
OVERALL....VERY GOOD

November 22, 2015
Dr. Z only sees as far as the glaucoma and doesn't look at how other conditions (i.e., blepheritis) impact the condition and are magnified by the medications--a different doctor pointed out the relationship which then led to marked improvement overall

November 17, 2015
Dr. introduced me to neuro Ophthalmologist to make sure.

November 14, 2015
As I have said before, i am beyond thrilled with the results of the cataract surgery. I am so very happy and satisfied with the treatment I receive from Dr. Zabriskie and his entire staff.

November 10, 2015
Superb in every way!

November 05, 2015
It doesn't get any better than this.

November 04, 2015
I do not have any complaints! I am very well informed about my eye surgery that I am going to have and I have no fear because of how well that they explained everything to me . I am confident that I am in good care!

October 30, 2015
Very Good

October 26, 2015
I love the Moran Eye Center and Dr. Zabriskie is so awesome!!!

October 20, 2015
Dr. Z is the greatest!

October 17, 2015
My experience was good, with quality care.

October 17, 2015
minimal exposure

October 16, 2015
Very happy with way I was treated by everyone,

October 14, 2015
Dr. Z was extremely helpful with the extreme pressure in my eye, and offered to help even though I didn't have a formal appointment with him

October 14, 2015
Dr. Z is great, he is always informative and very caring

October 12, 2015
I go in to Moran about once a week. excellent care, even the parking lot attendant is kind and attentive.

October 04, 2015
LOVE Dr. Zabriskie. He's the best.

September 30, 2015
I've recommended Dr. Zabriski and the Moran Eye Clinic to all my acquaintances.

September 27, 2015
Excellent experience

September 25, 2015
Because I am a bit older, It truly is nice to have step by step instructions in writing of what information was shared, my follow up instructions, care instructions etc. I try to remember and write a few things down but some of the terminology and the information I just can't remember. Us older folks need the Dr Seuss' made easy instructions.

September 21, 2015
very professional

September 21, 2015
Very good experience

September 16, 2015
previously stated. Every one was very kind & professional.

September 14, 2015
I have been going to Dr. Zabriskie for many years. His expertise is something that I trust a great deal. He is very professional and caring towards his patients. I greatly appreciate him, and his care of my eyes.

September 14, 2015
nothing bad. everything was good.

September 13, 2015
I am very thankful that Dr. Zabriskie continues to see me.

September 13, 2015
My care provider is excellent! I definitely refer him when people ask me!

September 09, 2015
Good experience.

September 08, 2015
I would have liked some information on the results of the test taken. Obviously it wasn't good as further treatment is necessary, but the on line records did not include information either, so I have questions.

September 01, 2015
I have come from out of state twice to see Dr. Zabriskie when I felt that my home community ophthalmologist was providing less than the best care I should be receiving. Dr. Z. confirmed this for me each time and has increased the monitoring of my eyes, added a new eye drop, and most recently, performed laser surgery for me. I believe he has dramatically improved the likelihood that I can preserve my vision. I trust him completely and expect to make the trip to come see him for many years to come.

August 31, 2015
highest praise

August 25, 2015
I'm a nurse and work for another large local healthcare company. I was so impressed with everything that happened at my appointment. After everyone had done an excellent job, they even brought in a neuro-opthalmologist from another clinic to look at my eye. I didn't have an appointment, and she was more than happy to come on over and check something out for me. I am so impressed and would highly recommend this practice to anyone.

August 25, 2015
Dr. Z the greatest. He always is personable and professional. Really cares.

August 17, 2015
I'm always praising the Dr's and assistants at Moran to everyone.

August 17, 2015
it was all good - thank you

August 16, 2015
Good experience

August 16, 2015
I've been bounced back and forth between Dr. Zabriskie and another opth. who referred me to Dr. Zabriskie because of his expertise with glaucoma. I would really prefer to stay with Dr. Zabriskie being that I have had to come back to him twice for new problems. This wasn't an option that was given to me.

August 06, 2015
I know the doctor is busy but he always seems in a hurry.

August 03, 2015
only a very positive experience

August 03, 2015
great communication

July 27, 2015
Dr. Zabriesky is always caring and takes time to listen.

July 22, 2015
Care was outstanding and left nothing to be desired.

July 17, 2015
Dr. Zabriski has been great to me since my first visit in 2012. Very attentive and concerned. I have full confidence in his treatment of my eye.

July 12, 2015
Dr. Zabriskie is very skilled and I appreciate what he is trying to do to save my sight. I really enjoyed his fello Dr. Bodiready (sp) I felt he wasn't as pressured to get to the next patient and could spend a few more minutes answering questions.

July 12, 2015
good

July 10, 2015
Very thorough

July 07, 2015
Dr. Zabriskie chose other medications in conjunction with latest eye surgery (Trabeculectomy) as all we have tried make me ill. All worked GREAT this time. No side effects.

July 06, 2015
We are so thankful that our daughter is a patient of Dr Zabriskie. He has been her Dr for nearly 6 years and I have no doubt in my mind that she has been able to keep the vision that she has because of him. He is a very busy man, but he genuinely cares about his patients and shows it at our visits.

July 05, 2015
I will certainly recommend Dr Z. he really did wonders for me.

June 27, 2015
everything was good.

June 27, 2015
Good r

June 25, 2015
I have great confidence in Dr. Zabriski and think he's wonderful!

June 23, 2015
I'll recommend Dr Zabriskie to all my friends, and Facebook friends, so they can get the AWESOME CARE that I received from him.

June 22, 2015
Dr. Zabriskie has been one of the best I've ever had; I wish all of my physicians showed the level of confidence, courtesy, and care that he does.

June 22, 2015
Very brief exchange with the attending Physician. Greater time and interaction with the Resident.

June 15, 2015
Before poceeding with any arrangements for eye surgery, I am waiting for results of MRIs of back and throat, and ultrasound of thyroid.

June 15, 2015
great place

June 15, 2015
I'm losing confidence in the effectiveness of my visits to the Moran Eye Center. I clearly am experiencing a long-term issue but each time I come in, the problem is addressed with bandaid measures. The doctor is polite and concerned but rushed. I feel like he is competent and knowledgeable but too hurried to help me understand if there are long-term solutions.

June 14, 2015
Some things were confusing and my questions were not answered very clearly. However, a follow-up phone call from Dr. Zabriskie explained all -- thank you!

June 11, 2015
Dr. Zabriskie was in a tough spot. We were seeing him as a second opinion. There was some confusion between him and his office about my mother wanting HIM to remove the lens and not Dr. Goff. I know it was a miscommunication, but my mom felt like she was left hanging. Dr. Goff never called us after conferring with Dr. Zabriskie, and Dr. Zabriskie's office never called us until 3 days later. My mom was left with the feeling that no one cared or was going to help her.

June 10, 2015
very helpful visit in many ways.

June 10, 2015
Dr. Zabriskie is an excellent eye doctor!

June 10, 2015
It would be good not to have to tell 4 different people the same thing, should be the Dr only

June 02, 2015
Dr. Zabriskie has saved my eye sight!!!!!!

May 29, 2015
The "care provider" spent, in my opinion, an appropriate amount of time with me.

May 24, 2015
My doctor made me feel like I was in good hands.

May 19, 2015
very good

May 19, 2015
Always caring and professional. My extended need for care has proven my Dr. to have the upmost concern.

May 19, 2015
Dr. Zabriskie is great.

May 16, 2015
It is such a pleasure to have Dr. Zabriski for my doctor. He always makes us feel welcome and important to him. Takes time explain every thing which I greatly appreciate.

May 16, 2015
always a pleasure

May 14, 2015
Dr Zabriskie and his staff are just the best!!

April 29, 2015
I LOVE Dr. Zabriskie and Dr. Vitale. They are OUTSTANDING! Their assistants are excellent.

April 27, 2015
Dr. Z and his staff are the best. I always feel so confident that I'm getting the best care!

April 25, 2015
I felt very confident about the information I received about my condition.

April 24, 2015
Good

April 21, 2015
We tell people if you have a eye problem, the ones to see are at John A Moran Eye Center. We can not say enough good about you. Thank you

April 20, 2015
This seemed to be a very rushed day in the clinic with this care provider. I normally have had more time spent with me.

April 20, 2015
I will refer The Moran Eye Center to everyone I know

April 18, 2015
always great service

April 16, 2015
We have been very impressed by the care and professional way everything was conducted. You may be sure we will recommend you to anyone with eye problems. Thank you

April 13, 2015
Dr. Zabriskie is an outstanding doctor

April 13, 2015
It's clear the demand for the doctor's time is very high. We can see him rushing from room to room, doing a good job while he's there, but being as brief as he can while still doing his job. I have learned that in most(other) visits to the U medical system, I can plan on the appointment taking a reasonable amount of time, usually less than an hour. I have learned that at the Moran Eye Center, I need to plan on up to two hours, which will be mostly waiting and then five minutes with the doctor at the end.

April 12, 2015
Dr. Zabriskie is an excellent doctor.

April 05, 2015
outstandingmedicine is working!!! the first with their guidance!!!

April 04, 2015
The staff explained the options i had and the results based on my decision. They explained the procedure and what would be occuring

April 02, 2015
I was told by Dr Zanriske that he would call me in the next few days. it has been 10 days and I have not been contacted

March 15, 2015
I felt like all personnel cared about my problem and tried to address the issues.

March 14, 2015
Dr.Z and the staff were all very informative. I asked questions regarding a new test and a new piece of equipment, and was explained to very well.

March 14, 2015
Totally recommend Dr. Zabriskie to anyone!

March 09, 2015
Specialist (Dr. Zabriskie) was very good, the doctor before needs a little work on dealing with patient questions without getting defensive.

March 07, 2015
I was very impressed with the quality of care provided by the care provider.

March 06, 2015
I never felt that the Drs. were rushing, they gave me plenty of time to think of questions and made sure that I understood their answers. They did a good job of explaining how they reached the conclusions and recommendations they provided me.

February 23, 2015
Dr. Zabriskie has a great way of instilling confidence and showing his concern. I do trust him. But I left feeling unsure of what was going to happen. Sorry to say this, but the first doctor and I did not communicate well. I did not feel his concern though he said he was trying to tell it to me straight. I wanted to be understood and to understand the implications of the surgery or laser treatment. He thought he was doing that, but I left with a bit of frustration. Then Dr. Zabriskie sees me. He is absolutely polite and considerate and you want to trust him. I felt as though the first doctor told him what I had said and I am not sure he always got the whole message. Dr. Zabriskie is quick and organized, but I would like more time with him to really know the answers. I had concerns after getting home and had to call back with questions. These doctors do this all the time. Eye treatments are so commonplace to them. But to those of us who are new at this, we need more reassurance.

February 22, 2015
Excellent!

February 22, 2015
Dr Zebriskie has fine tuned his staff coverage so that the appointment time moves well with little wait time for the patient. I feel I receive his full attention and concern. Excellent care for which I am very grateful.

February 09, 2015
LOVE Dr. Z!!

February 01, 2015
Always go above and beyond any expectation I have

January 31, 2015

Dr Zabriski and his team are excellent.

January 15, 2015
DR Zabriske has been my doctor for quite sometime. He is the best. His staff is excellent. I have complete confidence in DR Zabriske. I would definetly recommend him to all. Thank You

January 12, 2015

I have already recommended John Moran Eye Center to several close friends.

I like my doctor

December 22, 2014

December 18, 2014
Dr.Zabriskie and his assistants were excellent. Because of the attention and dialogue with the team I felt very confident about the outcome from start to finish.

December 05, 2014
I went into this exam terrified of having cataract surgery. But, my fears were greatly relieved and I have scheduled the surgery. my treatment was compassionate and informative.

November 23, 2014
I always recommend Dr Zabriskie and the team at Rocky Mountain.

November 21, 2014
Very good experience

Excellent

October 12, 2014
I know I am receiving the best care available, but I would like just a minute or two to have my concerns addressed.

I have recommended the Moran Eye Center and Dr. Zabriskie many times.

September 21, 2014
The very best

Excellent facility and exceptional services provided. I would recommend this facility to any one needing eye care.

September 19, 2014
All of the stall were excellent

September 14, 2014
The doctors I have interacted with, without exception, showed breat knowledge and paid especial attention to my heslth care as if I were the only patient in the entite Center. i feel particularly very positive and am extremely grateful for Dr. Zabrieskie.

September 05, 2014
Dr. Z is tops in my book, I would prefer not to see any other Doctor.

September 05, 2014
Dr. Zabriskie has truly changed the quality of my life! Although I still have to use drops in my eyes every day, he focused more on the root cause rather than just treating the symptoms. Ever since he performed the laser surgery on my eyes, only a few months ago, the pressure has continued to improve. I no longer have the pressure headaches I used to have almost on a daily basis, nor do I have to still use the drops that made my hair fall out!I will always be extremely grateful for his expertise and care. I cannot thank him enough! I still think about how grateful I am to him, almost on a daily basis!

September 02, 2014
I fully believe that if I had'nt come to the Moran eye center I would be blind in my left eye by now.

August 31, 2014
Dr. Zabriskie, while being conscious of his schedule, always gives you the time you need to make sure you understand everything before you leave. He is very dedicated to trying every possible treatment to help his patients. He is not afraid to think outside the box. I completely trust him, and I have only said that once before in my life.

August 29, 2014
every body and the experience was great

August 26, 2014
I would never have stepped foot back into Rocky Mountain retina. But my doctor from Moran Eye Center recommended Dr. Zabriskie, that's The only reason we came there. Now I'm glad I did he seems like he knows what he's doing and I think I'm in good care.

August 25, 2014
Dr Zabriskie is one of the best doctors I have ever had treat me. He is caring and very concerned about the issues I have with my eyes.

August 19, 2014
All the discussion about my eyes was clear and concise.

August 18, 2014
I was totally impressed with Dr. Zabriskie's friendliness, concern for my comfort and feelings, knowledge and advice. I felt confident with his service and will be happy to see him again.

August 17, 2014
All association and conversations doctor and staff members were informative, courteous and professional.

August 09, 2014
It was very good.

June 16, 2014
Am very pleased

June 16, 2014
We did not discuss my medications.

June 08, 2014
Dr. Zabriskie is an amazing doctor!

June 07, 2014
I was amazed that Dr. Zabriskie would see me the next morning at 8:00. My surgery with him lasted until 6 PM the previous evening.....on top of 14 other surgeries, I was told !!!

June 05, 2014
Dr. Zabriske is the best

June 05, 2014
Staff is super and Dr. Zabriskie gives me every confidence in his abilities thru his caring concern for my problem with my eyes.

The appointment went well.

April 14, 2014
over all care given to me, is great i go to your center every six month and Dr. Zabriskie works well with my provider here in New Mexico. between both i feel that i have the best care possible. Please Keep Dr. Zabriskie in your clinic he is a very good at taking care of me.

April 06, 2014
I couldn't be happier or more impressed with the doctor and his care. After several years, I finally feel like I have a better understanding of the issues with my eyes and I have hope with the short and long term plans and care. I feel very lucky and blessed for the opportunity I've had to visit with a specialist at the Moran Eye Center. I was extremely concerned about my insurance not covering or allowing me to visit the Moran Eye Center. Although the Moran Eye Center is not covered on my plan and I have yet to receive the first bill/statement, I was very grateful to find Dr. Zabriski as a participating doctor on my healthcare insurance plan. I can't express enough how much I appreciate him, his care and care, and I certainly hope my healthcare coverage will continue to facilitate/cover my option of continuing with his care at the prestigious Moran Eye Center.

April 05, 2014
Spacific instructions were discussed several times, and suggested next visit was discussed in detail.

March 30, 2014
This is a great organization at all levels

March 17, 2014
All good.

March 14, 2014
I have the up most respect, confidence, and trust for Dr Zabriskie. I choose him for these reasons.

Dr. Z truly cares about his patients.

February 18, 2014
good experience

February 16, 2014
dr. Zabriskie is always in a hurry and that is a little disconcerting, but he has such good people answering questions and giving instructions that it is okay. he is such a good doctor and I am sure many patients need his time. your office is very organized and run well to allow for that! I have complete trust and confidence in how I am being treated there.

February 14, 2014
Dr. Byzant is one in a million; his concern for my welfare and that of my husband is amazing. We appreciate him so very much. He takes time to make sure everything is taken care of - including our concerns.

February 11, 2014
Amazing experience.

February 09, 2014
Very Good

February 03, 2014
I would never go anywhere else for my eye care.

February 02, 2014
I didn't feel rushed or pushed through the appointment

January 28, 2014
wE HAVE TOTAL CONFIDENCE IN DR. ZABRISKIE

January 26, 2014
Top notch service--the best of all medical experiences including entirely different kinds of practices.

January 26, 2014
Moran eye center is the model for all clinics, I would say.

January 24, 2014
very polite and educational! We now have options we didn't have before, thank you guys for taking the time of day to examin and then give educated options!

January 19, 2014
I have recommended to many of my family and friends

January 17, 2014
I can wait to go again the 27 of january

January 16, 2014
though I thoroughly enjoy dr. zabriskie, this appointment could have been avoided if he had taken the time to go over the notes from my local doctor. once he did look at them (while I was there), he decided that the laser I had traveled to have performed was not necessary.

January 02, 2014
It was some good old fashioned medicine. The Doc even had his personal medical bag.

December 20, 2013
Good

December 17, 2013
Dr. Zabriski is exceptional.

December 17, 2013
My past & present experiences with Moran Eye Center doctors has always been wonderful. I have seen Dr. TESKE & Dr. ZABRISKE for many years. I never worry about the expertise & care I will receive from them.

December 14, 2013
I was hoping for better news, but Dr. Zabriskie did have two possible solutions.

December 13, 2013
In addition to being an excellent physician, Dr. Zabriskie is genuinely caring and takes time to thoroughly address questions and concerns.

December 12, 2013
Top notch outfit.

December 08, 2013
Dr. Zabriskie and the other care givers did a great job, and we felt very happy with her treatment.

December 07, 2013
Dr. Zabriskie had read my chart, going back 20 years and multiple other doctors. This is a big deal, because some doctors don't read it. He made arrangements for me to be followed by a local Wyoming doctor to reduce the number of trips I need to make to Utah.

December 06, 2013
Two thums up!!!

December 06, 2013
Excellent service.

December 06, 2013
I drive from ogden to see Dr. Z because he is so good. I have all the confidence in the world in his abililities and skills. I also want to say that the entire office staff is in my opinion, the best around.

December 05, 2013
I have never dealt with a doctor who was more courteous, friendly, and concerned about my well being as Dr. Z.I had a wonderful experiance from start to finish.

November 25, 2013
There were some hiccups with my first cataract surgery, but I was pleased with the way in which we were going to proceed before operating on my right eye.

November 25, 2013
Dr. Zabriskie is such a good doctor. I feel like he cares about my situation and has a real concern for my health.

November 24, 2013
Dr. Z. is sooooooo rushed that I don't feel comfortable raising questions, but it doesn't get in theway of giving me quality care.

November 18, 2013
Very thourough and took time for me to understand what is happening. Didn't seem to rush thru my appointment.

November 15, 2013
Dr Zabriske is the greatest I trust him with all my vision care do not want to go anywhere else

November 11, 2013
The doctor's were excellent . I know they are extremely busy and I appreciated being worked in their schedules. It is very frustrating to be 500 miles away and trying to do things over the phone.

November 11, 2013
Dr. Zabriskie is the best! I haven't seen many of the other Dr's, but the care given me at the clinic has been amazing!

November 10, 2013
he is young and that isn't a bad thing gaining experience -- would appreciate reassurance from Dr. Zabriskie too

November 06, 2013
I would have preferred to see my actual doctor on my follow up appointment instead of one of his assistants.

November 04, 2013
I have the highest degree of respect and trust in Dr. Zabriskie.

November 03, 2013
Each staff person made every effort to inform me and answer questions so that I would have a good outcome to my cataract surgery.

November 03, 2013
Great people at Moran

October 30, 2013
Dr Zabriskie, like the 'Energizer Bunny' keeps working and working and working to cure the western states of blindness all in his lifetime. He is efficient, kind and very hard working! Very favorable!

October 29, 2013
Excellent doctor. I have full confidence in him. Very caring.

October 27, 2013
Everyone at Moran is very nice and easy to work with.

October 23, 2013
Excellent

October 19, 2013
The reason I drive to SLC is Dr Zabriski.. He is terrific... and I trust him completely. you only get 2 eyes.

October 18, 2013
I thought Dr Zabriski would look at my eye too but was assured it was fine and I was good to go....

October 14, 2013
was fast but specific, good results on test gives me alonger time before needing to return

October 11, 2013
what more can I say but Thank You.

October 10, 2013
All good - wonderful!

October 03, 2013
good

October 02, 2013
This was a very unusual visit. the Dr. seemed to be behind with appointments and didn't have the qualified help he needed. I had question left unaddressed but know that the next visit will be better.

September 30, 2013
loved the doc.s mannerisim and patience he explained things well

September 27, 2013
Very professional. Thanks!!

September 21, 2013
I felt that I was a guest and that everyone was concerned about my well-being and comfort.

September 20, 2013
I have total faith in Dr. Zabriskie and his staff

September 11, 2013
good

September 10, 2013
Dr Zabriskie moves right along, but is always very efficient and kind. He shows he cares and definitely knows what he is doing.

September 05, 2013
Dr. Zabriskie is always thorough, explains care clearly and shows concern for me as a potient

September 05, 2013
I am very pleased with the care provided by Dr. Zabriskie.

September 04, 2013
Dr. Zabriskie is a personable and excellent physician. He cares.

September 04, 2013
Dr. Zabriskie is fabulous. Very caring doctor.

September 02, 2013
Dr. Zabriskie seems very knowledgeable, caring and willing to work with the patient and not just dictate what he wants. That is important to me. His assistants and staff members are very professional but caring as well. I have had excellent care at the Moran Eye Center.

August 19, 2013
good

August 03, 2013
was even given printed instructions regarding the time sequence for my eye drops. The Dr. wanted to make sure that I understood the procedure, and the assistant made ssure that I had a copy of the instructions.

July 29, 2013
Both Dr. Lu and Dr. Zabriskie were gracious, competent and generous with their time and work on my behalf. I don't know how I could have been treated better! This was far from my first encounter with an eye surgeon, and I was a bit apprehensive about the visit as this was a new-to-me procedure that was discussed. Both doctors helped put come to a sense of confidence in a reasonably positive outcome at while at the same time making clear the inevitable risks involved. I feel secure by putting myself andmy eye in their hands.

July 23, 2013
Stitches needed to be removed. Dr Zabriskie did it himself.

July 18, 2013
Dr. Meng Lu consulted with Dr. Zabriskie before taking out my stitches. Both Dr Zabriskie and Dr Meng Lu are very professional and kind. I have had the upmost respect and confidence in both doctors throughout my entire surgery experience. I am very pleased.

July 17, 2013
I have the upmost confidence in Dr. Zabriskie's opinions and his care. My husband is also impressed.

July 17, 2013
I have total confidence in Dr. Zabriskie. He is quiet but friendly, always thanks patients for coming and when he speaks, everyone in the room knows who's in charge. During surgery he spoke softly to his assistant but was definitely in command. I felt secure under his command.

July 05, 2013
I was seeking a second opinion and got two! One from Dr. Zabriski, and one from the Dr. who saw me before Dr. Zabriski.

July 05, 2013
We had a list of questions for Dr. Zabriskie and he answered them with one hand on the door.

June 28, 2013
good

June 18, 2013
always outstanding

June 18, 2013
I hardly saw Dr. Zabriskie and he seemed rushed.

June 14, 2013
good

June 09, 2013
I don't trust my eyes to anyone except Dr. Zabriskie

June 09, 2013
many of the questions are not relevant for an annual eye check up.

June 05, 2013
They were knowledgeable and very confident. Since I had been struggling so long with my glaucoma pressures it was really nice to be with people who are very familiar with this.

June 03, 2013
Dr. Zabriske has consistently been a kind and concerned provider and always listens to and respects my opinions. He is the reason I stayed with Moran

May 28, 2013
Everyone was helpful.

May 21, 2013
Would not go anywhere else. Feel very confident in the care that I am getting.

May 13, 2013
didn't really pay attention to the problem. just breifly looked at it and said come back later. I went in for extreme eye pain and sent me away without any thing to help the pain or without barely looking at the eye. I wasn't even dialeted

May 09, 2013
Dr Zabriski is the best. I have great confidence in him.

May 08, 2013
good

May 05, 2013
Dr. Z is the most kind and caring Dr. I've ever been too. I love and respect him!

April 22, 2013
Good experience

April 22, 2013
I drive from OGden to the Moran Eye Center and to Dr. Zabriski because of the trust I have in his knowledge and the fine service i receive from the staff/

April 15, 2013
Overall and in each particular Very Good.

April 01, 2013
Dr. Zabriskie and all of his assistants have excellent demeanor and take exceptional steps to insure I am comfortable and understand why and what is being done. They answer all my questions usually before I've thought to ask them.

April 01, 2013
Good

March 30, 2013
I have been coming for the past 2.5 years. The services provided by the Moran Eye Center physicians saved my eyesight. I am so very grateful and I do recommend your services to everyone I speak with.

March 29, 2013
I would recommend Dr Z to anyone. He is very knowledgeable and forthright, you don't have to read between the lines with him. He says it like it is and I like that.

March 22, 2013
Totally content with the service, attitude and care provided.

March 21, 2013

March 21, 2013
Good experience

March 17, 2013
Had a great experience!

March 11, 2013
Dr. Zabrskie has treated me for glaucoma for 20 years, and he is an excellent doctor. He always explains things to me and he always answers my questions.

March 06, 2013
I was impressed by the excellent explainations on what medications were being given and when and how to administer them. It also helped that the written copy was used in the explanation and sent with me.

March 01, 2013
Good experience. I felt the Drs. are doing everything they can to get my Glaucoma under control. I felt confident in Drs. Zabriskie and Marshedi

February 25, 2013
Top notch

February 25, 2013
thank you for all you do

February 19, 2013
Can't say enough good about the care and the people.

February 18, 2013
Provider is always in a BIG rush but is, I suppose, thorough enough. Just leaves impression of "rush, rush."

February 18, 2013
My entire experience with Dr. Zabriskie, and those assisting him, has been extraordinary.

February 18, 2013
good people and excellent care

January 28, 2013
Again, treated very well by ALL staff/Drs.

January 28, 2013
I was pleased with the efficiency, the level of information, and the patient care. All very professional, yet personable.

Would definitely recommend Dr. Zabriskie.

January 21, 2013

January 14, 2013
My appointment was very brief this time.

January 11, 2013
All individuals in the entire facility have been extremely competent, courteous and friendly

January 11, 2013
Both, Dr. Zabriskie and Dr. Morshedi were great! They both listened to me and validated my wishes and concerns.

December 27, 2012
I was very concerned about the trouble I was having with my eyes, and I was made to feel much more comfortable about the outcome.

December 24, 2012
good

December 21, 2012
Dr. Zabriski is a wonderful, caring and competent Doctor

December 10, 2012
Dr. Zabriskie is very "to the point' and straightforward in his approach---inspires my confidence in him

December 10, 2012
good

December 10, 2012
Actual time with doctor could be less rushed.

December 04, 2012
All providers were as competant and professional as the limited time for interaction would allow.

December 04, 2012
My care providers are the best!

December 03, 2012
Would like to stay with Dr. Z

December 03, 2012
good

November 30, 2012
My responses all pertain to Dr. Zabriskie, who I LOVE. He is a fabulous doctor!! However, I was seen by a fellow, Dr. Weber, before I saw Dr. Zabriskie. Dr. Weber actually turned his back on me and whispered with a resident or medical student about my field of vision results. It was very inappropriate. There's no reason they couldn't have discussed the results with me. Why are MY test results top secret? This is not the way Dr. Zabriskie deals with his patients, so I hope his approach rubs off on Dr. Weber.

November 29, 2012
My every six month check-up for glaucoma feels like I'm being 'herded' from one corral to another.

November 29, 2012
GOOD

November 26, 2012
Good.

November 26, 2012

November 19, 2012
Dr. Zabriskie is an excellent physician.

November 19, 2012
Dr. Zabriski is wonderful! I have seen him at Moran Eye Center, this is the first time I have seen him in this faciltiy and I am glad because it is closer to where I reside.

November 16, 2012
i would recommend this doctor - if the patient could wait for the surgery

November 16, 2012
The amount of time that was spent with me was enough to meet my needs. the doctor was busy but stayed with me until my needs were met.

November 12, 2012
Dr. Jacoby was excellent. At one point when there were issues she did not hesitate to call in other specialists and dealt with it promptly.

November 07, 2012
Dr. Zabriskie is an excellent eye physician

November 05, 2012
I really enjoyed my visit. The staff was wonderful and I really liked Dr. Zabriskie (my first visit with him)

October 29, 2012
I was referred to a Moran specialist by another Opthomologist. He took over the practice of the now-retired doc I used for years. I much prefer all of the providers and staff at Moran over those in my "regular" doctor's office. Moran staff are exceptionally pleasant and caring, yet efficient and professional. They do not talk down to anyone and seem to welcome questions.

October 15, 2012
Dr. Zabrisky has been recommended to all my friends with any eye problems.

October 15, 2012
I have recommended a close friend who loves working with your firm.

October 10, 2012
Always very excellent.

October 10, 2012
First a resident came in and was very thorough and answered what concerns I had, Dr. Zabriskie then followed ,,,he was very concerned about all of my questions and answered the questions on my level and put me at ease.

October 08, 2012
All went very well

October 04, 2012
Norm is the greatest!

September 24, 2012
Everyone at the Moran does their job very well. I would (and have on many occasions) recommended them to others who are now very satisfied patients.

September 19, 2012
There were no problems. Everything went very smoothly.

September 18, 2012
Dr. Zabriski provided a clear explanation of the results from my tests and was able to compare them from previous tests over the past five years, with positive feedback.

September 17, 2012
I could not be happier with the treatment I get at your office - your entire staff is outstanding.

September 13, 2012
I have had very good service throughout my Moran experiences.

September 13, 2012
I feel that Dr. Zabriskie and everyone I encountered at the Moran Eye Center are my angels. I'd been asking my previous Doctor for the past year to help me find someone else to add to my eyecare team. I'm sorry that an urgent matter got me to the Moran Eye Center and Dr. Zabriskie, but I'm so grateful to have found you. I have complete confidence with my new team of professionals and I'm telling everyone I know about the wonderful people of Moran Eye Center.

September 10, 2012
Excellent experience!

September 10, 2012
We only trust Norm Zabriskie and pay completely out of pocket even though we could go elswhere and be covered by Insurance, he is exceptionally kind and I wouldn't feel safe with anyone else in Utah.

September 06, 2012
I have nothing but good things to say about all of you

September 06, 2012
Very satisfactory

September 03, 2012
Very personable and forthright. Pleasant and not rushed. Willingness to explain options and repeat items that weren't heard the first time.

September 03, 2012
All above items were the best that could be asked for. I will recommend Moran to anyone.

September 03, 2012
Dr Zabriskie is excellent.

August 27, 2012
Very good experience.

August 27, 2012
Dr Zabriskie has been my ophthalmologist for 20 years. He is friendly, informative, thorough and I have a lot of faith and trust in him as a doctor.

August 13, 2012
I have all the confidence in Dr. Zabriskie. He has previously found problems and took care to give me the best instructions and choices for the problem. I would and have recommended him to friends.

August 11, 2012
Pleased with health provider

August 08, 2012
Elderly patients need more time with their doctor. It "feels" like he is in the room for less than two minutes and also that he is always in a hurry because he is swamped. The elderly just need to be reassured that they have been heard.

August 06, 2012
Very much appreciate Dr. Zabriski and his concern for my condition. Feel extremely comformtable.

August 04, 2012
I could not be more confident that I am in the best hands possible for my condition. Dr. Zabriskie always explains what he is doing and why, asks for my input and has always been very gentle with me

July 30, 2012
Exceptional service

July 25, 2012
I feel I get excellent care at the Moran Eye Center. I have recommended it to others many times. Keep up the good work!

July 23, 2012

July 16, 2012
I would definitely recommend the Moran Center

July 16, 2012
The staff and Dr. Zabriskie are the best care givers I have had.

July 14, 2012
Good experience

July 12, 2012
Excellent care and professional office

July 06, 2012
Good.

July 02, 2012
I felt like everyone was very nice but that since my son is a baby, they just sent me back to his pediatric eye dr and that my visit was a waste of time.

July 02, 2012
I am very happy with Dr. Zabriskie and his staf!

June 26, 2012
Dr. Zabrinskie is a true professional, knowledgeable and personable. I have full confidence in him! Excellent experience!

June 25, 2012
I come to SLC for the Eye Center and Dr. Zabriski. My vision is worth the trip. Thank you for the excellent care and professionalism.

June 20, 2012
Dr. Zabriskie is great!

June 19, 2012
Dr. Norm is so caring and shows a great deal of concern and compassion, he is a great man!

June 19, 2012

June 18, 2012
Thanks for YOUR TIME and Services -----even under demanding circumstances than normal.

June 11, 2012
Dr Zabriski is the best. I have great confidence in him and his knowledge

June 11, 2012
Service, courtesy, and treatment left nothing lacking. Excellent, could not have been better.

June 08, 2012
They are the best

June 04, 2012
Such a good experience. So confident of the quality of care.

June 04, 2012
Dr. Zabriskie is humane. He is the first doctor ever to call me at home to check on me. He gave me his cell phone number and asked me to call him any time if there was any problem. He saw passion in him for what he does. He maintains a communication channel open with patients.

June 04, 2012
Dr. Zabriskie always takes the time to answer my questions and explain his findings thoroughly. I have never felt rushed or like I couldn't ask questions.

May 18, 2012
I felt very comfortable thru the entire visit..

May 01, 2012
good

April 26, 2012
Dr. Zabriskie was great and provided the exact information I was looking for during this second opinion appointment.

April 26, 2012
No mention was made about the results of the visual-field test that had just been conducted, as though it was not worthy of mention. I did not have the wit to ask about it at the time, but wondered about it later.

April 25, 2012
Excellent

April 24, 2012
excellent

April 24, 2012
This operation is so professional in every way ?"best practices" all the way around.

April 20, 2012
Dr. Zabriskie always spends the time needed.

April 19, 2012
Shows compassion and explains condition very well.

April 12, 2012
Dr. Zabrisky always seems rushed. This is probably a good thing so that he doesn't keep patients waiting. I always want to know what the results of my tests are. He just says "good" and I want to know what the test was for and where in the range I fit. The optical scan results were of interest to me but he barely had time to let me look at them and justsaid "You're good." I didn't feel slighted, it's just that they're my eyes and when I spend a lot of time doing a test I want to know what the data showed. Same for the the pressure, etc.

April 12, 2012
Very good.

April 12, 2012
Good

April 10, 2012
The Best

April 10, 2012
I have noticed that when my eye pressure is high Dr. Zabriskie rechecks it, but when it is in a satisfactory range he dosent.

April 05, 2012
It was all good.

April 03, 2012
Very good

March 29, 2012
Very Professional

March 27, 2012
Time was brief but totally sufficient for need.

March 27, 2012
Good

March 22, 2012
I think the doctor was being interrupted all the time and had to help with other situations. I felt he could have been friendlier if he wasn't being so rushed.

March 20, 2012
good

March 15, 2012
I had questions which they answered satisfactorily and an eye exam for new glasses.

March 15, 2012
very go0d experience

March 13, 2012
Dr. Zabriskie is both professional and warm & welcoming. He is an exceptional doctor and I would recommend him to everyone I know.

March 08, 2012
Everything went just great. All seemed very concerned

March 08, 2012
Norm is the most caring provider I have ever encountered.

March 06, 2012
I feel I am well cared for and can trust the care provider.

March 05, 2012
excellent

February 28, 2012
Recently, the woman doctor I had was very attentive to my concerns and very positive and careful in determining that I understood her recommendations.

February 23, 2012
All Good

February 22, 2012
good

February 17, 2012
Many instructions written

February 16, 2012
This was not a very good experience . I didn't even see the doctor but his assistant conversed with him about my care.

February 16, 2012
Always good experiences

February 14, 2012
Good experience with the doctor

February 09, 2012
I can never say enough about everyone there. It is like you are part of a well functioning family.

January 31, 2012
I would recomend anyone to go there i allready have talked to other people who need the same thing done and told them to have it done here.

January 31, 2012
We feel totally fortunate to be under the care of Dr. Zabriskie

January 26, 2012

The testing and explanation of results is absolutely outstanding in every way!

January 26, 2012
We are very satisfied with the care and concern displayed by Dr. Zabriskie

January 19, 2012
The Moran is the best care we have received.

January 19, 2012
The visit was very good. He reviewed my tests and clinical findings and answered my questions.

January 19, 2012
My son just had Lasik at Christmas & I recommended my neighbor who has seen doctor Zabriskie.

January 17, 2012
Fantastic in all areas

January 12, 2012
I have a lot of faith in Dr. Zabriskie and his staff

January 10, 2012
Dr. Zabriskie is the best! I have often told him you have to have a great deal of trust to let someone operate on your eye (which he has done multiple times)

January 05, 2012
I have never had a bad experience coming to this office. Every thing has been positive.

January 03, 2012
Very good profosscial care, and concerns of mine are always answered. I really like my Dr.

January 03, 2012
I am always recommending my care provider to others. I have great confidence and respect for the entire facility
