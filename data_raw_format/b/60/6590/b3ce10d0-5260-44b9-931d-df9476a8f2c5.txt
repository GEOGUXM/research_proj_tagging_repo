Robin draws on her training and experience in movement, somatics and performance in her Gallatin courses. Awareness and consciousness form the core of her classes whether in a performance format, an introduction to body awareness techniques or exploring one's anatomy. In addition to her arts workshop courses she is repeatedly asked to teach an energy medicine tutorial. With over thirty years in the field of holistic health she combines health and healing methods both at Gallatin and in her private practice. Robin is a clinical social worker and maintains an integrative private practice. She was a field supervisor for the NYU School of Social Work for 12 years and a psychotherapist and supervisor at the St. Marks Institute for Mental Health. She is the author of The Working Woman's Guide to Managing Stress (Prentice-Hall) and the co-author of Coping for Kids (Prentice-Hall). She has also written articles for The Holistic Nurses Journal and Reiki News. Robin has lectured and run groups at hospitals, colleges and businesses in the New York area and been the source for numerous magazine and newspaper articles.
