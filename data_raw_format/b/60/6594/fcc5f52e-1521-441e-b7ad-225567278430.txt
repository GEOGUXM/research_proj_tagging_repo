My research in road safety began in 1988 when I began post graduate studies with the UBC Accident Research Team in Vancouver, B.C., Canada. Since then I have worked in almost all areas of road and traffic safety. Crash testing, accident analysis, numerical modeling, and analyzing vehicle test data have been my methods to understand why and how we are injured in a crash.
