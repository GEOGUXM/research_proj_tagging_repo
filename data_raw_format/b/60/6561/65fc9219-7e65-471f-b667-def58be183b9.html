In the wake of 9/11, the large-scale processing of data for security purposes became a priority for law enforcement authorities throughout Europe—and the safeguarding of an individual’s right to data protection a key concern for all those defending a rights-based approach. Security-oriented actors and those defending data protection interests have struggled to find compromise in the EU institutions, meaning that the core of the policy is still to be settled. Since the Treaty of Lisbon and the inclusion of data protection as a fundamental right, the necessity to solve the tension between large-scale data processing for security purposes and the right of individuals to data protection has become more pressing.  - Key words: data protection; EU</p> <p></p>

After briefly presenting Convention 108, the analysis that follows will highlight the Council's data protection sys- tem currently in effect as well as developments relating to the Convention's amendment so far with the aim of identifying improvements and shortcomings. While doing this two separate points of view shall be adopted: at first a micro point of view will attempt to identify improvements and shortcomings through an 'insider' perspective, that is, judging only the merits and difficulties of the draft text at hand. Afterwards a macroscopic view will be adopted, whereby strategic issues will be discussed pertaining to the important issue of the relationship of the suggested draft with the EU data protection system, as well as, the same draft's potential to constitute the next global information privacy standard. - Key words: data protection law</p> <p></p>

It will also briefly describe the current state of governance to demonstrate that international norms followed data privacy legislation from the inception.&lt;br/&gt;The second part will elaborate upon the complexities of the contemporary processing environment by referring to two case studies, cloud computing and location-based services. These two examples will demonstrate that the transborder personal data flows model, as accommodated and implemented, has substantially changed in the past few years, at both the national and international level. Contemporary global and complex personal data processing makes international governance of data privacy more necessary than ever.&lt;br/&gt;The third part of this paper elaborates upon the three plausible scenarios for the future. First, the status quo could remain. In this case, we suggest that technology will step in by offering technology- based solutions, such as Privacy By Design system architecture or Privacy Enhancing Technologies, to address the concerns of individuals about the best way to protect their private data. The second scenario considers the amendment process of the European data protection framework and the EU Data Protection Directive in particular. It predicts that an improved and updated version (likely in the form of the currently-developing EU General Data Protection Regulation) could constitute the international standard for data privacy either indirectly or directly, through streamlined application of its adequacy criterion. The third scenario recommended by the authors proposes the establishment of an international data privacy organization, preferably a UN agency, to govern international data privacy. The appropriate regulatory vehicle is perhaps already in place: the globally-accepted, but probably undeservedly underused, 1990 UN Guidelines for the Regulation of Computerized Personal Data Files. The field could also benefit from the examples of other sectors that achieved international governance status after decades of persistent efforts, despite the fact that they fostered similarly pervasive legislation, such as copyright.</p> <p></p>

SCRIPT-ed 9: 314-339.  ▸&nbsp;<a href="javascript:toggle('366')">Abstract</a></p><p class="abs" style="display:none" id="366">Abstract: Museums are, in most cases, publicly-owned holders of vast amounts of information that are, by definition, open to everyone. Location restrictions, however, usually limit public access. The Internet could change this: once museums digitise their collections and upload them onto their Internet sites, online access would be possible for anyone, anywhere. The difficulty in this case would be that there are practically thousands of museums around the globe, ideally each maintaining its own Internet site. Users therefore face substantial difficulties when conducting research online. From this point of view it is probably a self-evident development to aggregate online museum content in a single website, in order to facilitate user access. This explains the initiatives, for instance, of Europeana from the public sector and the Google Art Project from the private sector - each one in terms of content volume and user exposure holds a pre-eminent position among its (Internet) peers. These initiatives, however, are disruptive, both as regards business methods and legal systems, challenging traditional notions and treading at the borders of well-established legal principles and long-serving rules and regulations. This article discusses the legal issues raised by the contemporary aggregation initiatives of museum content over the Internet, by reference to the above two initiatives. Questions relating to copyright, the sui generis database right, as well as, the issues of systems' interoperability, public sector information and restitution will be addressed in the analysis that follows. - Key words: intellectual property rights</p> <p></p><p class="download">▸ Download <a href="http://script-ed.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/dehert.pdf" target="_blank">http://script-ed.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/dehert.pdf</a></p>

Telecommunications (electronic communications) have benefited from sector-specific data protection legislation since 1997, when the first relevant set of regulations was released. Today, the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the "ePrivacy Directive") 2 governs the field; its latest amendment, in 2009, brought forward the third in chronological (if not in generational) order relevant regulations. - Key words: law &amp; technology</p> <p></p>

It identifies a set of common basic principles and standards for the genuine assurance of data protection in all the phases of EU policy-making and for the effective implementation of this fundamental right. The study puts forward a set of recommendations to guide the European Parliament's role and legislative inputs into the upcoming revision of the EU legal framework on data protection, which is expected to be launched by the end of 2011. - Key words: privacy; data protection; european union; european parliament; fundamental rights</p> <p></p><p class="download">▸ Download from <a href="http://shop.ceps.eu/book/towards-new-eu-legal-framework-data-protection-and-privacy-challenges-principles-and-role-europ" target="_blank">http://shop.ceps.eu/book/towar…nges-principles-and-role-europ</a></p>

Plans to introduce an intra-EU PNR processing system initiated since 2007, although strongly supported by the Commission and the Council, did not bear fruit before the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and the, institutional, involvement of the Parliament. While discussions have been suspended since October 2009 and most probably a new draft proposal will be produced, it is perhaps useful to present in brief the proposal currently in place so as to highlight its shortcomings for European data protection and suggest ways individual protection may be strengthened in future drafts. - Key words: data protection law</p> <p></p>

Nevertheless, they may constitute at the same time a brutal invasion into individuals' privacy. After an extensive effort to define precisely data matching and distinguish such processing from similar filing operations, a data protection approach will be attempted through a given axis of analysis in order to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of this legislative approach. - Key words: data matching; data protection</p> <p></p><p class="download">▸ Download from <a href="http://ijlit.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/9/1/39" target="_blank">http://ijlit.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/9/1/39</a></p>
