About: 
Dr. Chabot has spent the duration of his career at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia since 1983, when he began his internship in transplantation. He has dedicated his career with resolute focus on the prevention, treatment, and cure for pancreatic cancer. Having progressed from intern, resident, and fellow to Professor, mentor, and Executive Director of the Pancreas Center at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia, Dr. Chabot intimately understands the culture and practice of medicine and surgery at the hospital. He is in a well-grounded position to lead ColumbiaDoctors in responding to the challenges associated with rapid innovation, advancing technology, and the highly informed patient.
In addition to serving as Executive Director of the Pancreas Center, Dr. Chabot is Chief of GI/Endocrine Surgery at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and the David V. Habif Professor of Surgery at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.
