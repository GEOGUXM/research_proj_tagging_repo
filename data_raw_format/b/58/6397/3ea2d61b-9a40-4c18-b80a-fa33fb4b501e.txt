Susan M. Hoffert, MD
Assistant Professor of Clinical Emergency Medicine
Bio
Susan is a native of Cleveland, Ohio.  After graduating in 1988 from John Carroll University with a B.S. in physics and a minor in English literature, she moved to Chicago with plans to pursue a Ph.D. in astrophysics while her husband completed a Ph.D. in nuclear physics.  However, she soon came to realize that, instead, her desire was to become a physician.  She graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Medicine in 1995 and began residency in pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine/Riley Hospital for Children.  After taking three years off in the middle of residency to care for her young children, she returned to complete pediatrics training in 2001, and has been a full-time faculty member at the Riley ED since that time. She exclusively works overnight shifts.
Susan has served on the Pediatric Code Committee since 2003.  In 2008, she received the Red Shoes Award for Outstanding Accomplishments and Contributions to Family Centered Care at Riley Hospital.
She lives on the far eastside of Indianapolis with her husband Mark, now a medical physicist for IU Proton Therapy in Bloomington, and two children, who keep her busy with their activities when she is not at work.
Caring for acutely and chronically ill children is her passion, and she finds the utmost satisfaction in the successful diagnosis of a rare or perplexing case.
