Profile

Reto Geiser is a designer and scholar of modern architecture with a focus on the intersections between architecture, pedagogy, and media. He is the Gus Wortham Assistant Professor at the Rice University School of Architecture where he teaches history, theory, and design. A registered architect in Switzerland, he studied architecture at ETH Zurich and Columbia University in New York, and holds a PhD from ETH Zurich. He previously taught as the 2003–2004 William Muschenheim Fellow at the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning at the University of Michigan, and as a lecturer in architectural criticism at the Institute for the History and Theory of Architecture (gta) at ETH Zurich. In 2007 he was appointed as Marshall McLuhan Fellow to the University of Toronto.
Geiser's writings have been published in anthologies and such publications as Abitare, Future Anterior, and Hunch. He is the editor of award-winning Explorations in Architecture (Birkhäuser, 2008), and the series editor of Standpunkte Magazine, and Standpunkte Dokumente. He is in the process of completing a book manuscript that traces aspects of cultural transfer and transatlantic exchange in the work of Swiss art historian and architecture critic Sigfried Giedion. Current research includes the project “Print and Screen” an investigation of the shift from print and post-print production and new forms of publishing in the information age.
In 2005 Geiser established Standpunkte, a platform and publishing venture for promoting dialogue and critical exchange among emerging voices in architecture and its related fields. He serves on the advisory boards of the Depart Foundation in Rome, and the Lucius & Annemarie Burckhardt Stiftung in Basel, and is a committee member of the European Architectural History Network (EAHN).
A founding principal of the collaborative design practice MG&Co., Reto is developing spatial strategies in a range of scales from the book to the house, exploring the boundaries of design and research with a special focus on the intersections and overlaps between architecture, installation, textiles and typography. His curatorial works include the exhibition "Explorations: Teaching, Design, Research," Switzerland’s official contribution to the 11th Venice Architecture Biennale.
