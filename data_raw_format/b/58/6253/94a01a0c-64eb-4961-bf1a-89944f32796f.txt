Dr Samy Sakkal
BSc (Hons), PhD (Monash), GradCertTertEd (VicMelb)
Lecturer, College of Health & Biomedicine
Dr Samy Sakkal is a lecturer and researcher in the College of Health and Biomedicine where he is based at the St Albans campus and at the Western Centre for Health Research and Education. He has a particular focus on practical and theoretical immunology education and manages the VU flow cytometry facility.
Samy has an interdisciplinary background - his work is at the intersection of immunology, stem cell biology, neurobiology and exercise physiology.
His research seeks to address the shortage of immunology knowledge and its application in neurobiology and exercise physiology. Before joining VU Samy worked for the Australian Stem Cell Centre and Monash University. There he studied macrophage biology in models of kidney and lung disease in addition to developing a functional assay to identify ureteric bud progenitors.
His PhD from Monash University (2010) titled “Regenerative Potential of the Female Thymus in Natural and Induced Models of Thymic Involution” explored the impact of pregnancy, lactation and corticosteroids on maternal thymus plasticity.
Samy is a multi-award winning immunology educator whose passion for teaching has been recognised by a $10,000 National Teaching Award from the Australian Government Office for Learning and Teaching in 2013. He received a citation for Outstanding Contributions to Student Learning. He has also been recognised by the Vice Chancellors Awards for Excellence Teaching (2013) and more recently by a College of Health and Biomedicine Teaching Excellence Award (2015).
