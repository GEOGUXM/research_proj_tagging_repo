Short Bio:
Dr. Jon Bush completed undergraduate, medical school, and residency in anatomical pathology in Manitoba before moving to Chicago and Northwestern University/Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago for a one year clinical fellowship in pediatric pathology (while attending a few Cubs baseball games). Dr. Bush is yet to develop a core research interest but has worked on projects ranging from transplant and GI pathology, soft tissue/bone tumors, and infectious disease histopathology. His clinical interests are wide but he particularly enjoys medical-biopsy and transplant pathology and has a “soft” spot for soft tissue tumors. Another area of clinical interest is perinatal/placental pathology and cardiovascular/respiratory pathology, stemming from his training in Chicago.
