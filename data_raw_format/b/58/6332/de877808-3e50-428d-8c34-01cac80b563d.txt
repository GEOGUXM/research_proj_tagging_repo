MSc
SOCIAL AND EVOLUTIONARY NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH GROUP (SENRG)
I am interested in the effects that diverse linguistic structures may have on human cognition, communication, and sociality. I completed my MSc. in Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology at at Oxford's Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology, where I researched the evolution of leadership. Prior to that, I read a BA in liberal arts, at the Liberal Arts College of Concordia. I focussed on literature, and then worked for several years as a journalist. Coming from this background in the humanities, I hold an abiding interest in the light that contemporary experimental psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology can shed on the evolution of storytelling and ultimately, the enjoyment of literature.

I am currently reading for a DPhil in Experimental Psychology at Oxford. My PhD is co-supervised by Professor Robin Dunbar (Oxford), and Professor Asifa Majid (Radboud University). It focuses on the role language plays in the development of social cognition, and the implications this has for the evolution of language.
