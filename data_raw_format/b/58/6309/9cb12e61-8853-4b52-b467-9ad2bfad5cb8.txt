Biography
Bill Murphy is an engineering geologist with close to 20 years of experience of research, teaching and consulting in the broad geotechnical field. His expertise is landslides and slope stability, with a specific interest in how the ground performs during earthquakes. Recently he is developing interests in modelling landslide systems with respect to establishing resilient ground engineering for changing climate systems. Field areas include New Zealand, Califronia, Italy and the UK amongst others. In addition to his research activities Bill has been a consultant to Arup; Halcrow; SRK and URS/Scott Wilson amongst others.
Bill Murphy is the program leader for the MSc Engineering Geology. He holds a BSc from the University of Strathclyde and a PhD from University College London. Dr Murphy is a Fellow of the Geological Society and a member of the Society of Earthquake and Civil Engineering Dynamics. He is currently a member of the Geotechnique Advisory Panel and sits on the Editorial Board for "Engineering Geology".
