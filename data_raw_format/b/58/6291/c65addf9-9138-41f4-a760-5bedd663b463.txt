Prof Mostert's undergraduate studies in Humanities and Law at Stellenbosch University piqued her interest in the resource potential o f land. Throughout her doctoral studies she pursued the question of how land as a scarce resource of great public importance could be appropriately regulated, whilst simultaneously private claims to it could be acknowledged. Having honed her research skills at the Max Planck Institute for Public and International Law in Heidelberg, Germany, she completed her doctorate in 2000. Since then, through her appointments at Stellenbosch University (2001 and 2008), the University of Cape Town (since 2008) and the University of Groningen (since 2010), she shares her insights with new generations of prop erty law students. Her work has had impact both locally and internationally, through her involvement in the International Alliance for Land Tenure and Administration, and the support she provided to the South African Law Commission, World Bank and counsel in international and national litigation.
Prof Mostert's original interests in property law matured into specialisations in Land Law and Mineral Law. In these fields, she has contributed to the most authoritative sources on South African Law, addressing issues of constitutional property protection, landlessness, tenure security, rest itution, nationalisation, land governance and mineral resource regulation. Her work on mineral law has been cited with approval by both the Supreme Court of Appeal and the Constitutional Court in South Africa. She emphasizes the state's duties to achieve better living standards and ensure responsibl e individual autonomy. She defends the notion of engaged citizenship in the enhancement of freedom and quality of life for individuals and the community and comments on the role of the judiciary in building a society subscribing to principles of accountability and trust in property law.
Prof Mostert is rated by the National Research Foundation (NRF) as an internationally renowned researcher. She also held fellowships of the Commonwealth Programme, the Max Planck Foundation, the German Academic Exchange Service and the Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation. The South African Department of S cience and Technology nominated her as a finalist for the Young Women in Science Award 2012.
