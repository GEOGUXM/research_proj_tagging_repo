Full CV
Dr. Kathryn Ross is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Clinical and Health Psychology and in the Social and Behavioral Sciences concentration in the College of Public Health and Health Professions. Dr. Ross received her M.P.H. (Biostatistics concentration) from the University of Florida in 2012 and her Ph.D. (Clinical Psychology, Health Psychology track) in 2013. She completed the Obesity Research Track APA-approved clinical internship and an F32-funded postdoctoral fellowship at the Brown Clinical Psychology Training Consortium and Weight Control & Diabetes Research Center at the The Miriam Hospital. Dr. Ross’s postdoctoral fellowship focused on training in cost effectiveness analyses and the conduct of a randomized pilot trial assessing the impact of newer self-monitoring technology, with and without additional phone coaching, on weight loss in overweight and obese adults. After the end of her postdoctoral fellowship, Dr. Ross joined the faculty at the Weight Control & Diabetes Research Center and the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at the Brown Medical School. Dr. Ross moved back to Gainesville to join the faculty in the Department of Clinical & Health Psychology in the summer of 2016.
Dr. Ross currently teaches within the Social and Behavioral Sciences concentration in the MPH and PhD in Public Health programs. She advises masters and doctoral students both in the Department of Clinical Psychology and in Public Health.
Research Focus
Dr. Ross’ research focuses on the prevention and treatment of adult obesity, with particular emphasis on improving the long-term maintenance of weight loss and developing effective behavioral weight management interventions that can be disseminated on a public-health level. Increasingly, she has begun to investigate the integration of newer technology into weight management interventions as a way of lowering cost of treatment delivery and increasing intervention reach.
Dr. Ross currently has an R21 from NIDDK (R21 DK109205) aimed at identifying and characterizing high-risk periods for weight regain following initial weight loss. Using a rich longitudinal dataset that she collected while implementing and assessing an Internet-based weight loss program within an existing corporate wellness program, Dr. Ross and her collaborators will use novel statistical techniques to identify the points at which individuals change trajectory from weight loss/maintenance to regain, and then use a set of time-varying covariates (data collected daily and weekly) to develop predictive algorithms for these “high risk” periods. These results will be used to inform the development of a novel, just-in-time adaptive intervention for weight loss maintenance.
