Biography
A native of New York City, I received my undergraduate degree in History from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. After several years of teaching high school in Florida, I returned to North Carolina for graduate study at the University of North Carolina – Chapel Hill. From 2008 to 2013, I taught at North Dakota State University in Fargo, North Dakota.
With my colleague Frank Coglino, I host the podcast The Whiskey Rebellion.
