Biographical Summary
Dr. Rodica Damian is an Assistant Professor of Social Psychology at the University of Houston. Her current research examines the role of diversifying experiences, life events, and personality by social context interactions on personality development, and downstream consequences for creativity, status attainment, and well-being. Dr. Damian studies these topics using multiple methods ranging from controlled laboratory experiments to large longitudinal studies that track people's lives and real-world outcomes over time. She collaborates on this research with colleagues across North America and Europe.
Dr. Damian has published more than 20 scientific papers and chapters so far, including several articles in international peer reviewed journals such as the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Journal of Research in Personality, and Social Psychological and Personality Science.
Research Interests
My research program is dedicated to understanding the precursors of status attainment, creative achievement, and well-being. In doing so, I use a person-by-situation interaction framework, where I examine the interplay of life experiences, social background factors, and individual differences, with a focus on the underlying cognitive and developmental processes. In particular, I am interested in diversifying experiences, which include both adverse and diverse life experiences, such as poverty and multiculturalism, respectively. I seek to understand how diversifying experiences, contribute to personality development, career success, and well-being, and why some people are better than others at coping with adversity and using diversity to their advantage.

Prospective Graduate Students
I am looking for highly motivated graduate students to join my team starting Fall 2016.
Are you curious which factors promote success, creativity, and happiness? How life experiences and social contexts shape our personalities and change us over time? Why some people thrive against all odds, while others are crushed by the weight of their misfortune? And how we can benefit from diversity in today’s globalizing world?
If you want to join my lab in this exciting scientific quest, then apply for admission to the Social Psychology program at the University of Houston. Feel free to email me if you have any questions.
