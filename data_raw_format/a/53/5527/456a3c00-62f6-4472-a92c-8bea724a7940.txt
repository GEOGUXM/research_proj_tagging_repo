Roberta Rotman
Roberta Rotman
Roberta Rotman's scholarly work and teaching mainly focus on the transformation of literary works into the visual and performative arts of film and theatre. This emphasis flows from her earlier work as a professional actor in Chicago. In her research she has explored novel-to-film translation, audience reception of plays in performance, dramatization of history on screen and stage, and the tension between text and music in the early English opera libretto.
