I joined UVic Law in 1990 and was promoted to associate professor in 1999. I served as associate dean (academic) from 1993 to 1995 and from 2000 to 2005, and as Associate Dean Administration and Research from 2006 through 2009. I teach Administrative Law and Law, Legislation and Policy. My research interests include administrative law, statutory interpretation and employment law. Prior to joining the Faculty, I practised law for almost 10 years, serving as a government lawyer with the Constitutional Law Branch of the Saskatchewan Department of the Attorney General from 1980 to 1987 and then moving to Ottawa, where I worked with the federal Solicitor General's Department and the Canadian Human Rights Commission from 1987 to 1990.
