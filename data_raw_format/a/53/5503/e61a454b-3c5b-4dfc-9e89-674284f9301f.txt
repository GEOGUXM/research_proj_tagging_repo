I joined the former School of Management at the University of Leicester in 1997. Prior to this appointment I taught organisation studies, business ethics, marketing courses, and statistics theory at the University of Oxford, Canterbury Christ Church University, and the Deutsche Private Finanzakademie, Munich.
I received a PhD (D.Phil.) in social studies/green consumer studies from the University of Oxford (1996), and a PhD (Dr. rer. pol) in economics, ethics and organisation theory from the Catholic University of Eichstätt at Ingolstadt (2001/2003). I studied management studies and economics at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich (Dipl.-Kfm), the University of Birmingham, the University of Oxford, and the Catholic University of Eichstätt/Ingolstadt. More recently, my teaching has included courses on business ethics, and research methodology. I'm a senior fellow of the Higher Education Academy (SFHEA).
I've been working closely with Japanese institutions – I obtained research fellowships from The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science in conjunction with the Kanazawa Institute of Technology (KIT) (2013; appointed as research fellow at the Kanazawa Institute of Technology 01 April 2013 – 31 March 2014), and from The Japan Foundation in conjunction with the Business Ethics Research Center (BERC), Tokyo (2005). As an undergraduate I held a student scholarship at the Hanns-Seidel-Stiftung, Germany (1989–1991). In 2016 I obtained two grants from the Teaching Development Fund (TDF) of the College of Social Sciences, Arts, and Humanities of the University of Leicester for setting up and developing a peer-assisted learning (PAL) scheme.

Research
My interdisciplinary research draws on institutional and constitutional economics and projects this approach to questions of philosophy, ethics, religion, and the history of political and organisational economic thought. I trace ‘economics as ethics’ in my research on religious texts, philosophical texts, texts of organisation theory, as of business ethics and CSR theory. By doing so, I can challenge basic assumptions about the nature of such texts; its key motivations and significance; and how they reflect on modernity and modern ethics (i.e. economics as ethics). Here, I point towards the emergence, however basic, of modernity already in ancient text.
In normative ethical perspective, my research targets ideals such as mutual gains at the micro level of interactions, which involve individual agents; and at the macro level, his research examines ideals such as the ‘wealth of nations’. From this vantage point, moral claims are aligned with (institutional and constitutional) economic intervention strategies. My research covers a range of sources such as the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, the writings of Hobbes and Smith, to more recent advances in the history of organisation theory, such as the writings of Taylor, Simon or Williamson. My previous research projects include the anthropological and cognitive study of green, environmentally-friendly consumer behaviour.
