Brian Morton
 Professor of Biological Sciences
  Brian R. Morton, Professor of Biological Sciences, joined the Barnard faculty in 1995.
Professor Morton's research focuses on two main aspects of the evolution of plastid DNA.
The first is the selective constraints on codon usage across a wide variety of phyla of the plant kingdom. He is attempting to determine how and why selection intensity varies among lineages as well as over time. He is also interested in finding out how selective constraints on codon usage interact with other structural features, such as amino acid composition of proteins and genome organization.
His second major line of research involves an investigation of the nucleotide substitution dynamics of plastid DNA. Professor Morton and his research team are studying the ways in which rate heterogeneity among sites is affected by variation in context, or the composition of nucleotides flanking those sites.
