CONTRIBUTIONS
High-Stakes Real-World Experience
Before joining Tulane, Professor Spindt worked in Washington D.C. for the Federal Reserve Board. There, he began working with abstract economic concepts and eventually became more engaged in capital markets and banks, interested in looking at institutions and how they operate. This led him to his work with financial economics, and he has since shared his background with students
Expanding Freeman’s Influence
Professor Spindt has played an instrumental role in building a first-class finance department at Freeman – a program now widely recognized as being one of the best corporate finance programs in the world. He also started a Latin American Ph.D. program, partnering with a school in Mexico and expanding the program to include a number of other institutions in Latin America.
Extensive Publications
While Professor Spindt’s current focus is on the health and development of the Freeman programs, he boasts a lengthy publication record in top journals, with more than 30 papers published.
MEMORABLE MOMENT
Professor Spindt’s investiture into the dean chair was especially memorable – both because of the significance of the role and because of the celebration itself, including a dinner at the president’s house.
