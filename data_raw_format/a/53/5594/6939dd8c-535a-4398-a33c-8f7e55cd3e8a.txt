EDUCATION

RESEARCH INTERESTS / PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
Dr Norman Rosenblum graduated New York University College of Dentistry in June, 1974. Upon graduating he immediately entered the private realm, working as an associate in a private practice in Brooklyn. Several years later he established his own office, also in Brooklyn, in which he maintained a private practice for nearly 30 years. From 1979 until 1998 he served as an "attending dentist" in the residency program at the Seaview Hospital & Home in Staten Island, at which time the program was discontinued (due to the City budget cuts of the Guliani Administration.). He has since rejoined the Dental Department there, and now serves on a visiting basis at their clinic, involved in the direct care of its clients. Upon leaving his private practice, Dr. Rosenblum joined the faculty at NYU, first on a part-time basis, and in October, 2004 on a full-time basis, and is involved in both the pre-clinical and clinical supervision of its dental students. He is a member of the Academy of General Dentists.
