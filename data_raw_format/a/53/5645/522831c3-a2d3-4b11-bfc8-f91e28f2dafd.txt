Dr Wang completed a PhD in the field of crisis management in 2011 at the University of Queensland. Her current research interests are associated with risk and crisis management in the tourism, travel and hospitality context. Crisis prevention and risk communication have been transformed by technical innovation. Risk decisions are made in partnership with those affected and empowered. Her research has focused on understanding how humans perceive and act in relation to risk and crisis, with the research objective to bring about change (related to perceptions, beliefs, attitudes, feelings, behaviour, or any combination of these) that improve the welling-being and safety of people and organisations.
