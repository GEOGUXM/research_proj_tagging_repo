Bio
Tonio Buonassisi is Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT. He heads the MIT PVLab, a research laboratory with an interdisciplinary focus on photovoltaics and system design. His research interests include solar energy conversion, predictive process simulation, defects, multiscale characterization (synchrotron), photoelectrochemistry, system design and modeling, including technoeconomic analysis. Working in collaboration with over two dozen solar-energy companies, he contributed to the development of various solar-cell technologies in commercial production today, including the initial technology for Calisolar (now Silicor Materials). He co-founded the Fraunhofer Center for Sustainable Energy Systems in Boston. The PVLab has a strong focus on education and community-building, and is involved in international research collaborations in Singapore, Mexico, Spain, and Brazil, among others.
