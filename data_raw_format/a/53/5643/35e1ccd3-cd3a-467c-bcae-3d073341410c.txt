Research Overview
Professor Asimaki's research combines geotechnical engineering, computational mechanics and structural dynamics to study natural ground surface features and man-made geotechnical systems --such as ridges, valleys, dams, tunnels, building foundations and offshore structures. One of her research areas is the development of predictive models of soil and foundation response to seismic loading, another area is the engineering of 'green' foundation solutions for offshore wind farms, which are subjected to complex dynamic loading from wind, waves, currents and the cyclical motion of the turbine rotor itself.
