Research Degree Supervisor
About me
I have been at the University of South Australia since moving from the Discipline of Paediatrics at the University of Adelaide in 2010. I teach undergraduate topics of developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, sleep, attention & consciousness, research methods and general psychology. I supervise Honours, Masters and PhD students in psychology. My research currently focuses on the importance of sleep for cognitive performance, child mental health, child sleep disorders, and the neural basis of cognitive functions. I co-established the Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory and also work in the Centre for Sleep Research.
