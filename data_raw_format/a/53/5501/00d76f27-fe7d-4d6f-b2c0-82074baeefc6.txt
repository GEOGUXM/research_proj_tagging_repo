Staff Profile:Dr Robert Hosfield
Name:
Dr Rob Hosfield
Job Title:
Associate Professor
Responsibilities:
Examinations Officer
School Technology-Enhanced Learning Advisor (STELA)
Areas of Interest:
British and Western European Lower and Middle Palaeolithic archaeology
Pleistocene fluvial landscapes
Experimental archaeology & site formation processes
GIS applications in Palaeolithic and prehistoric archaeology
Postgraduate supervision
Rob currently supervises/co-supervises three research students:
Alice la Porta: Use and technology of Middle Palaeolithic points (lead supervisor: Prof. Linda Hurcombe [Exeter University])
Li-Chi Chiang: Taiwanese Neolithic shouldered axes (co-supervisor: Dr Karen Wicks)
Sam Nicholson: Palaeoclimate of Arabia and implications for hominin dispersal (lead supervisors: Prof. Dominik Fleitmann & Dr Alistair Pike [Southampton University])
Rob is happy to discuss proposals for future postgraduate research in any areas of Palaeolithic archaeology, in particular: Lower and/or Middle Palaeolithic hominin behaviour and lithic technology, GIS applications, and
experimental archaeology (esp. focusing on tool use or lithic assemblage taphonomy). For further information, please contact Dr Hosfield.
Research groups / Centres:
Scientific Archaeology Research Group
Key Facts:
Rob teaches the Palaeolithic archaeology of Europe, global human origins, lithics, GIS and statistics for archaeologists.
Rob is currently leading, with Dr James Cole (Brighton University), an AHRC Network project: Coping with climate: the legacy of H. heidelbergensis.
Rob has recently completed a site monograph on the British Lower Palaeolithic site of Broom (Hosfield & Green 2013) and an edited volume in honour of Prof. Clive Gamble (Coward et al. 2015), and is currently working on a new book exploring the European early Palaeolithic from the perspective of a 'year in the life'.
Rob has recently published papers on the Palaeolithic and Holocene archaeology of the Wadi Muqadam region in Sudan, and is currently working on new papers exploring global patterns in Palaeolithic technology, the evolution of human attentiveness, and the challenges of Palaeolithic survival in mid-latitudes.
Rob’s recent fieldwork has been both at home (at the British Lower Palaeolithic site of Knowle Farm) and abroad: Easter 2013 saw him undertaking a Palaeolithic archaeology and landscape survey in Sudan (with Dr Kevin White and Prof. Nick Drake of King’s College London).
Rob’s other projects have included:
The Archaeological Potential of Secondary Contexts Project (funded by English Heritage through the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund),
The Palaeolithic Rivers of South-West Britain Project also  funded by English Heritage through the ALSF.
The Afon Ystwyth Experimental Archaeology Project (including post-fieldwork opportunities for students in 2013)
Research with Dr Nick Ashton (British Museum) exploring the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic archaeology of the Solent river system.
He has also published papers on the early Middle Pleistocene archaeology of Britain, the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic archaeology of the Solent (with Dr Nick Ashton of the British Museum), British Palaeolithic settlement histories (with Dr Ashton and Dr Simon Lewis, Queen Mary’s, University of London), the handaxe assemblage from the British Lower Palaeolithic site of Broom (with Dr Jenni Chambers), antiquarians and the Palaeolithic record, social learning and craft skills, and the interpretation of Palaeolithic assemblages from fluvial contexts.
He has been a Committee Member of the Lithic Studies Society , and has served as a council member of the Prehistoric Society (2005-2008).
Rob was involved with the South West Archaeological Research Framework (SWARF), acting as the period convenor for the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic, and has also contributed to the Solent-Thames Archaeological Research Framework (the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic archaeology of Berkshire; Wenban-Smith et al. 2014) and the Buckinghamshire and Milton Keynes Terrestrial Minerals Resource Assessment.
