Additionally, the study collected the birth registry records of Maharashtra state to analyse temporal changes in sex ratio at live birth over a period of last 32 years. The project setting was in an area within which, the non-governmental organisation, HMF coordinates a number of different health and social development program, and will thus was integrated in HMF's work specifically with the Anaemia Control Program (ACP).
The PhD was supervised by Dr Andrew Fogarty, Dr Puja Myles and Dr Laila Tata, based at the University of Nottingham, UK.
