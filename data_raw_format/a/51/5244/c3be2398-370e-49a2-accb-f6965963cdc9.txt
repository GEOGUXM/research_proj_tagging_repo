Research Interests
The role of GluR2 editing in motor neuron disease.
The AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 controls calcium entry to the motor neurone. During development it undergoes post transcriptional RNA editing giving rise to a mature form which blocks the receptor pore. There is evidence which suggests that in some forms of motor neurone disease this process is faulty giving rise to a receptor that becomes calcium permeable. In collaboration with colleagues in Edinburgh I am investigating this evidence in our own material.
Selective vulnerability to neurodegeneration of motor neuron populations.
In motor neuron disease there is a loss of motor neurons from the spinal cord and motor cortex but the motor neurons controlling eye movement (oculomotor) and the pelvic floor are spared. I am currently involved with a project to examine the gene expression profiles of both the spinal cord and oculomotor motor neurons in order to determine what mechanisms might be involved in the differential vulnerability of the two groups.
Microarray analysis of RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples.
There is a large archive of tissue samples collected for histological analysis that are formalin fixed and then embedded in paraffin. I have begun a project to develop a reliable methodology to unlock the RNA from these samples and make it available for microarray studies. This will enable us to carry out gene expression studies of some valuable samples in a number of areas.
