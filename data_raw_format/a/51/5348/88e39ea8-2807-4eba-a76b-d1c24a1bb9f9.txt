Biography
Rebecca studies the molecular mechanisms of human virus surface and replication proteins using a diverse toolkit of structural and biochemical techniques. She uses her discoveries to design novel vaccines and antiviral therapeutics. Before joining UCSC, she was a postdoctoral fellow at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France, and at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, TN. She received her Ph.D. in Biochemistry at UC San Diego and her bachelor's degree from the University of Colorado Boulder.
