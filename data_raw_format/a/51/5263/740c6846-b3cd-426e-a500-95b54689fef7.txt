Experience

During his postdoctoral fellowship in Toronto, Canada, Dr. Thrasher designed a research program in which he developed a new neuroprosthesis for walking therapy in people with chronic spinal cord injury. The neuroprosthesis has been used in a 16-week regimen of treadmill walking by over 24 patients. 80% of subjects experienced dramatic improvements in walking function. The efficacy of this intervention is now being tested in a randomized control trial at Toronto Rehabilitation Institute by a multidisciplinary team that Dr. Thrasher assembled to look at all aspects of the treatment from bone health to psychosocial factors. The intervention is also being extended to rehabilitation of hemiplegia due to stroke.
