profile

I am a member of the Healthcare Informatics Group at the Almaden Research Center. My current work is building tools that enable medical researchers to obtain clinical insights from aggregated healthcare data. My career has centered on various aspects of data management for over twenty-five years, including database recovery algorithms, federated databases and data integration, and bioinformatics and clinical data management. I received a Ph.D. from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1984, and have been working at IBM Research ever since.
