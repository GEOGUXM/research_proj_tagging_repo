Biography
Dr. Wang received his Ph.D. degree in 2004 in Dr. Eric Olson's lab at UT Southwestern Medical Center. He then joined the lab of Dr. Xiaodong Wang across the bridge for his post-doctoral training. In 2012, he became an assistant professor in the Department of Molecular Biology.
Necrosis is a process clearly distinguished from apoptosis and is implicated in many human pathological conditions, including infections, ischemic injuries, neurodegeneration and cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms of necrosis remain largely unknown. Using a combination of chemical genetics and biochemical approaches, Dr. Wang delineated the TNF-a-induced necrotic pathway into distinct steps and identified the mitochondrial protein phosphatase PGAM5 as a central player. PGAM5 also plays key roles in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium overload induced necrosis. This research brought new insights into necrotic cell death pathways and identified many chemical inhibitors of necrosis, which potentially will lead to therapeutic strategies to treat necrosis-related diseases. Activation of the necrotic pathways in tumors that are highly resistant to apoptosis will be a novel direction in cancer treatment.
At UT Southwestern, Dr. Wang will continue investigating the mechanisms of necrotic cell death, especially the executioners of the process, using unique chemical and biological tools. The in vivo functions of the key components of the necrosis pathways will also be investigated using mouse genetics and chemical biology.The ultimate goal of his research is to apply the knowledge to develop novel pharmacological interventions to treat necrosis-related human diseases.
