People
The Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology has a diverse group of people that make up our labs, with primary faculty, joint faculty, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and researchers. MMI faculty are active in the scientific community and within OHSU, serving on NIH study sections, as editors for prestigious journals, and as members on university committees and councils. The department maintains close collaboration with the Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute as well as Providence Portland Medical Center, with many principal investigators at both locations holding adjunct faculty status with the department.
