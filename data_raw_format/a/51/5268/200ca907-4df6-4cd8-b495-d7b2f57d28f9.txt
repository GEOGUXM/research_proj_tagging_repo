Research interests
Dr Loveday's research is in two main parts consisting of written theoretical research and contemporary art practice. His written theoretical research has a number of themes, including an historical focus with published work on Marcel Duchamp, a focus on philosophical interpretation of alienation in regard to art and more recently, theories of moment. He has also written on various theories of art and architecture, including theories of the political aesthetics of third space, new media and the role of writing in art. The title of the written component of his practice-based doctoral thesis is, The Darkened Room, Painting as the Image of Thought, (Sydney College of the Arts, University of Sydney, 2006), drawing on the theoretical work of philosophers Deleuze and Guattari and Friedrich Nietzsche in relation to painter Bridget Riley.
His contemporary art practice consists of painting, video, photography and installation and has been exhibited both individually and in collaborative projects in institutional exhibition spaces, artist run initiatives and commercial galleries. His art practice has a central theme of alienation and irony, both of which use combinations of abstraction, text and various theories of signs and symbols. Included with some of his art projects are texts in the form of collected essays presented as books in which the two main parts of his research meet. The title of the practice component of his PhD is, The Planets.
His interest in postgraduate research supervision is in both theoretical and practice-based research, with an emphasis on contemporary art.
