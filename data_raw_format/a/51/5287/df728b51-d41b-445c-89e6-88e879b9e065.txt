Guanglei Hong obtained a Master's degree in Statistics and a Ph.D. in Education from the University of Michigan in 2004. She is a member of the Committee on Education at the University of Chicago. Before joining the University of Chicago faculty in July 2009, she had been an Assistant Professor in the Human Development and Applied Psychology Department in the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto.
Research
She has focused her research on developing causal inference theories and methods for evaluating educational and social policies and programs in multi-level, longitudinal settings. Her work addresses issues including (1) how to conceptualize and evaluate the causal effects of treatments when individual responses to alternative treatments depend on various features of the organizational settings, (2) how to adjust for selection bias in estimating the effects of concurrent multi-valued treatments, (3) how to evaluate the cumulative effects of time-varying treatments, and (4) how to conceptualize and analyze the causal mediation mechanisms.
Because advancements in these quantitative research methods are best illustrated and utilized through empirical investigations of prominent scientific issues, she communicates with a broad audience through applying the causal inference methods to studies of specific policies and practices in education and beyond.
Her research has received support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the Spencer Foundation, the National Academy of Education, the American Educational Research Association Grants Program, the William T. Grant Foundation, and the US Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences among other sources of funding. She has been elected to serve on the Editorial Boards of the Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, the Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness, and Effective Education. She served as the Guest Editor for the Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness special issue on the statistical approaches to studying mediator effects in education research in 2012.
Teaching
She teaches quantitative methods courses including Applied Statistics in Human Development Research, Causal Inference, and Mediation, Moderation, and Spillover Effects.
