Joseph Thomas Rabban III, MD, MPH
Research and Clinical Interests
My primary clinical specialty is diagnostic gynecologic surgical pathology, encompassing biopsies and surgical resections of both benign and malignant diseases of the ovary, fallopian tubes, uterus, peritoneum, vagina, vulva, as well as gestational trophoblastic disease. My main patient population consists of women who are seeking care at the UCSF Gynecologic Oncology division, OB/Gyn division, and Center for Reproductive Health. As a member of the UCSF Multidisciplinary Gynecologic Oncology Tumor Board, I work closely with surgeons, oncologists, and radiation oncologists to provide multidisciplinary recommendations for patient care. As a member of the UCSF Cancer Risk Program, I work closely with genetic counselors and gynecologic oncologists to provide multidisciplinary recommendations for assessing risk for hereditary basis of disease in women with gynecologic pathology. In addition I provide diagnostic consultation services to pathologists at institutions other than UCSF who request a second opinion on a gynecologic surgical pathology specimen. My secondary clinical specialty is diagnostic breast surgical pathology.
My clinical research focuses on differential diagnostic criteria and tumor classification in gynecologic disease,as well as pathologic phenotype-genotype correlation of inherited gynecologic cancers, particularly those associated with BRCA and Lynch syndromes.
My teaching emphasis is diagnostic gynecologic surgical pathology at the level of continuing medical education for practicing pathologists at national and international courses.
I direct the UCSF Fellowship in Gynecologic Surgical Pathology.
