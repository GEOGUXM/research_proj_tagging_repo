About the NASA Lab
We are the UCSD NASA Lab, from the UC San Diego Department of Medicine Division of Physiology. This is an archive of the lab and its past research. 
We conducted studies aboard the International Space Station, the NASA Space Shuttle, and the NASA Reduced Gravity Aircraft, studying various aspects of human lung function. You can learn more about all of these projects under Research.
