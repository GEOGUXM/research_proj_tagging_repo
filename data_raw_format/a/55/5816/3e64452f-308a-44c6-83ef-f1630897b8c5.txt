Biography
Lynette completed her PhD at UWA before taking up postdoctoral positions at The Johns Hopkins University. On returning to UWA, she continued her research in respiratory pharmacology, with an emphasis on airway nerve function and modulation. Additional studies have involved the effects of respiratory viral infection and allergic airways disease on airway inflammation, remodeling and hyperresponsiveness. Lynette was part of a nation-wide team that secured funding from the Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) for a project entitled “Ensuring quality graduates of Pharmacology”. She has developed a program in responsible conduct in learning and research that has now been embedded within the Pharmacology curriculum. Lynette leads the development and implementation of the multi-disciplinary ethics unit, Social Responsibility in Action SCIE2100, that is available to undergraduate students across UWA. She also developed the ASCEPT Mentoring Program.
Key research
Lynette is interested in:
- improving pharmacology teaching and learning in science and health-related courses
- increasing awareness, knowledge and critical thinking with respect to ethical issues
- gaining a better understanding of mechanisms involved in asthma
