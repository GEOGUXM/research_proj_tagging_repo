Professional interests
I am happy to continue my career at the Ohio State University Department of Family Medicine. I completed my residency training here and served as Chief Resident. I then stayed at OSU Sports Medicine to complete my Primary Care Sports Medicine Fellowship training. I am excited to be able to practice both Family Medicine and Sports Medicine here at OSU. I enjoy the variety of things that come into my clinic, including chronic illnesses, acute problems and prevention of disease. I love taking care of the whole family from the newborns up to our most cherished seniors and am honored to have the opportunity to do so.
