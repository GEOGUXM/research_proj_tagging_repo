Arlene Bierman
MD, MS
Professor
“My research focuses on improving access, quality and outcomes of care for older adults with chronic illness, with a special focus on socio-economically disadvantaged populations, inequities in health and health care, and the unique needs of older women.”
Dr. Arlene Bierman is a general internist, geriatrician, and the holder of the Ontario Women’s Health Council Chair in Women’s Health.
As the Principal Investigator of POWER (Project for an Ontario Women’s Health Evidence-Based Report Card), Dr. Bierman led more than 60 investigators in providing data to help policy-makers and health care providers improve health and reduce health inequities in Ontario. The POWER team developed a model for integrating gender and equity analysis into performance measurement and reporting, bridging population health and clinical practice, and using a community engaged research model in the context of a quantitative study.
Through the Patient-Centered Accelerated Improvement Teams for Heart Failure through Shared Care study, she is developing and testing a new model of care for complex patients with heart failure.
Dr. Bierman is a Founding Member and Board Member of the National Initiative for the Care of the Elderly (NICE). This international network of researchers, practitioners and students is dedicated to improving the care of older adults.
She is cross-appointed to the University of Toronto’s Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation as well as the Division of Geriatrics in the Faculty of Medicine. In addition, Dr. Bierman is on the faculty of U of T’s Institute for Life Course and Aging, a Senior Scientist in the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute at St. Michael’s Hospital and an Adjunct Scientist with the Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences.
