Biography
Prior to pursuing her LL.M. degree at Harvard University, Professor Ruparelia taught torts at the University of Ottawa and then clerked at the Court of Appeal for Ontario.
After completing her graduate studies, Professor Ruparelia joined the Prison Reform Advocacy Center in Cincinnati, Ohio where she established and directed a community legal clinic to assist ex-prisoners with legal issues impeding their transition back to society.
Her current research interests include torts, criminal law, critical race theory, and feminist legal theory.  Her recent publications have considered the impact of criminal law on racialized communities, as well as the capacity of tort law to redress racial discrimination. She is the co-editor of "Critical Torts", a collection of essays that explores the potential and limitations of tort law as a progressive tool for social change.
In addition to her teaching and research, Professor Ruparelia has conducted judicial training sessions on issues surrounding sexual assault and domestic violence. In addition, she has worked with the National Judicial Institute to plan and deliver anti-racism training to judges. Professor Ruparelia also has participated as a member of the Canadian Bar Association Standing Committee on Equity and the National Steering Committee of the National Association of Women and the Law (N.A.W.L.).
