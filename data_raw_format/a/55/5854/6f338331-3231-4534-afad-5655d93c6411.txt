“Social Science Fictions: The Scalar Aesthetics of Cold War Scientism” examines the production of science as an aesthetic category, tracing the ways in which scale emerges as its organizing logic and most persistent formal problem. By thinking of science as an aesthetic category, and not just an ideological or methodological one, this project reads the scientism of the Cold War as the foundation for a set of literary experiments with scientific modes of representation. Each chapter identifies a site of representational negotiation at the interface of the literary and the social scientific to track how the answers ventured to the question of how to scale representations to reality repurposed mathematical formalism in the service of social realism and developed modes of narrative representation for an age of statistical aggregation.
Joan Lubin is the 2017 John Money Fellow for Scholars of Sexology at the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research in Bloomington, Indiana.
