Research Interests
My research examines the cellular mechanisms underlying cognitive and sensory processes. Our primary interest is the Type IV phosphodiesterases (PDE4s), a group of enzymes related to dunce, which is a gene required for learning and memory in the fruit fly. Studies we have conducted on the distribution of PDE4s in mice point to possible roles in the processing of odors and pheromones. In addition, the localization of PDE4s to portions of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia suggest that PDE4s may participate in the regulation of a variety of behaviors. We are currently investigating the role of different PDE4 subtypes in addiction and depression using molecular, pharmacological and behavioral approaches in the mouse.
