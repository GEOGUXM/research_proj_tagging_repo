Biography
Dr Ignacio Martín-Fabiani is Research Fellow at the Department of Physics of the University of Surrey.
Prior to this appointment he obtained his PhD in the Institute for the Structure of Matter (CSIC) in Madrid. He applied several top-down nanostructuring techniques to polymeric materials such as Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPPS), Nanoimprint Lithography (NIL), melt wetting of nanoporous templates and optical near-field imprinting. 
He is currently working on a FP7 project, called BARRIER-PLUS, which is developing new waterborne, nanocomposite coatings as barriers against corrosion.
