    Research Interests
The research interests of our lab focus on disease epidemiology, disease management, and resistance breeding, particularly for fungal diseases of economically important crops.? Our work involves disease investigation, pathogen collection, in planta inoculation, and disease evaluation in the greenhouse and field.? In the lab, we conduct various trials including pathogen isolation, culturing, molecular genetics and biochemical experiments.? Quantitative genetics approaches are also used to uncover the complex components underlying plant resistance and pathogen virulence.? At present, we are mainly working to:1. develop new monitoring technique and forecast model for rice blast disease;2. establish a working system for the identification, characterization and application of quantitative disease resistance in rice;and 3. understand the genetic mechanisms conditioning virulence in Setosphaeria turcica, the causal agent of northern corn leaf blight.
