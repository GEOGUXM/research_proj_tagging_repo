Research Interests: 
As a music theorist, Rehding is interested in the question of how music has been understood at different times in history. This has taken his work in a number of different directions -- from Ancient Greek music to the Eurovision Song Contest. Much of his work has been dedicated to music and ecocriticism. (He believes he may have inadvertently coined the term “Ecomusicology” in a 2001 article.) He is currently interested in issues of slowness –  specifically music that spans vast amounts of time, thousands or even billions of years, and its function in raising critical awareness. He is the recipient of the 2014 Dent Medal of the Royal Musical Association (UK).
