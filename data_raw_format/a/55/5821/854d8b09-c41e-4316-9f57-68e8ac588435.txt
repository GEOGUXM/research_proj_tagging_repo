Biography
Personal Statement
I am a postdoctoral research associate in the department of Eye and Vision Sciences, working on developing a novel chemical crosslinker for the treatment of keratoconus, a disease of the eye which affects young people of working age, with Professor Rachel Williams and Professor Colin Willoughby. The project involves assessing the biomechanical, chemical, and biological changes occurring within chemically treated cornea.

My undergraduate training is in chemistry, from the University of Manchester. Coming from a pure science background I have experience in NMR, IR, UV-vis, and X-ray crystallography. I have experience in working with water-sensitive and air-sensitive compounds. My undergraduate degree projects included:
BSc project: Synthesis and Characterisation of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks
MChem project: Synthesis and Characterisation of Gold (I) Complexes with Potential Anticancer Activity.
My MChem project was where my interest in the medical application of pure science stemmed from. My PhD was in Biomedical Materials, also from the University of Manchester, titled: Fabrication of Novel Cytocompatible Membranes for Ocular Application, Concentrating in Particular on Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). The project involved the development of synthetic Bruch's membranes as suitable substrates for retinal pigment epithelial cells.

I am fully trained in aseptic technique, cell culture, and various biochemical assay techniques. I am also fully trained in electrospinning (nanofabrication), SEM, optical microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, surface functionalisation, XPS, and biomechanical analysis. I am interested in furthering my career within science for medical applications.
