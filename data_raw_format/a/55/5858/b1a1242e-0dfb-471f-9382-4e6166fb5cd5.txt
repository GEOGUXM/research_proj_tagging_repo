Short presentation
Terrestrial organic carbon (tOC) is an important energy source and structuring factor in temperate-boreal lakes. Increasing trends of this carbon pool in the environment due to climate change, reversed acidification or land use changes bring the necessity to know how lakes are going to behave in the future and which services will provide to society.  Food webs are a good framework to study lake community responses to tOC or other potential stressors in a changing environment.
