Research | Current
My current research focuses on the psychosocial impacts of living with aphasia and language processing in adults with aphasia, especially the production of verbs and sentences. I am particularly interested in the interface between linguistics, psycholinguistics and aphasia, as well as the development of theoretically motivated therapy methods for adults with aphasia.
New research projects aim to investigate
The differences between language processing and auditory processing after a stroke
Language difficulties in adolescents
The language of dementia

Current projects
Verb production in fluent aphasia: We know that verbs and sentences are problematic in aphasia (both fluent and nonfluent). Using the Argument Structure Complexity Hypothesis, this study investigated the linguistic and psycholinguistic bases for verb production deficits in fluent aphasia.
Measuring word frequency: For some time word frequency has been used as one of a range of reliable predictors of difficulty in evaluating lexical retrieval (in cases of word-finding difficulty). In order to better understand the usefulness of frequency as a measure, this study analysed a number of word frequency databases.
