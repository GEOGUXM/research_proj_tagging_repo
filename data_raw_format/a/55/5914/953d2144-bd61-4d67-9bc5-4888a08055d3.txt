Laura Chiticariu is the Chief Architect of Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU), where she builds NLU systems that are accurate, scalable and transparent. She believes in the notion of "Transparent Machine Learning" in NLU: leveraging machine learning techniques, while ensuring that the NLU system remains transparent - easy to comprehend, debug and enhance.

Previously, Laura was a Researcher in the Scalable Natural Language Processing (NLP) group in IBM Research - Almaden, where she built and led the transfer of NLP technologies to multiple IBM products, including IBM BigInsights, IBM Streams and Watson Knowledge Studio, and completed multiple customer engagements with Fortune 100 and multi-national organizations.
Laura has been teaching NLP in universities within and outside the U.S., and developed two online courses in the process.
Laura holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of California, Santa Cruz, and a B.S. in Computer Engineering with a major in Automation and Industrial Informatics from Politehnica University of Bucharest. In her spare time, she enjoys introducing kids to computer programming.
