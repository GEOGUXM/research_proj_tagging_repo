Profile
I grew up in Barnsley, South Yorkshire and studied for my BA at Hertford College University of Oxford. I moved to the Centre for the Study of Women and Gender at the University of Warwick for my MA and to the English Department at Queen Mary University of London for my PhD. I have been teaching at Queen Mary since 2007.
