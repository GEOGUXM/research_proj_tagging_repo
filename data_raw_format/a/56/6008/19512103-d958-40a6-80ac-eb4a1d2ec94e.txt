profile
Dennis Adams was born in 1948 in Des Moines, Iowa. He is best known for his public interventions and museum installations that address the processes of collective amnesia and social exclusion in the formation and use of architecture and public space. He has produced public projects in Austria, Canada, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Spain, The Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States. His work has been the subject of over 50 one-person exhibitions in museums and galleries throughout North America and Europe. In 1994, two separate retrospectives of his work were held at the Museum van Hedengdaagse Kunst Antwerpen and the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston. Currently, he is working on public projects in Munich, New York, Paris, and Sao Paulo. His work was represented in the Whitney Biennial 2000.
Mr. Adams has been a faculty member or Visiting Professor at numerous institutions including Cooper Union School of Art, Parsons School of Design, Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris, Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten, Amsterdam and the Akademie der Bildenden KÃ¼nste, Munich. He lectures frequently around the world and his published writings, interviews and statements have contributed to the discourse about the relationship of art to the urban context.
