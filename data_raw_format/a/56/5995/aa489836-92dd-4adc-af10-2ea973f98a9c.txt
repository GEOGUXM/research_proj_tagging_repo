BIOGRAPHY
A proud native of Arizona, I received my PhD in History from Emory University in 2015.  My dissertation examined the multiple understandings and constructions of German-Brazilian ethnicity in the mid-20th century.  During my studies I conducted research in various sites in Brazil, Germany, the U.S., and the UK.  This research was supported by the Fulbright Program, the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), and Emory University’s Laney Graduate School and History Department. 
 Prior to my PhD I received my B.A. from Georgetown University with majors in Comparative Literature and Spanish and a minor in German. My honors thesis dealt with issues of cultural hierarchies in ancient and modern translation practices. I then pursued a M.Sc. in Latin American Studies at Oxford University (Exeter College), awarded with distinction in 2006.My thesis looked at the political and philosophical history of Chile's most conservative and most popular party, the Unión Democrática Independiente (UDI).  In my non-academic career I've worked as a journalist in England and Colombia and trained Le Cordon Bleu in Paris for six months.
SPECIALIZATIONS / RESEARCH INTEREST(S)

RESEARCH DESCRIPTION
My work focuses on the intersectionsbetween (im)migration, race, ethnicity, and regional and national identities intwentieth century Brazil. My current book project, tentatively titled IndelibleWhiteness? Race, Nation, and German Ethnicity in Brazil explores the tensions among social meaningsof whiteness and German ethnicity that circulated in nineteenth and twentiethcentury Brazil.  In this and other projectsI am particularly interested in incorporating material culture such as tourism,cuisine, and architecture into my research.
