Biography
Having obtained a BSc (Hons) degree in Biology I started my scientific career as an Ecotoxicologist specialising in chronic toxicity of chemicals in aquatic species. A change in career direction then saw a move into the biofuels sector (at the University of Nottingham) working on analytical method development for the BBRSC Bioethanol LACE (Lignocellulosic Conversion to Ethanol) research project. A PhD in Bioenergy and Brewing Science was then completed. The PhD project focussed on the conversion of barley derived spent grains (BSG) to bioethanol. I am now a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in microbial biotechnology and molecular genetics. I am a keen Biologist and a full professional member of the Royal Society of Biology (MRSB) in addition to being a member of the Institute of Brewing and Distilling (IBD) and the American Society of Brewing Chemists (ASBC). I am also a chartered Biologist (CBiol) with the Royal Society of Biology. I also have MSc brewing science and practice module qualifications and numerous scientific publications.
