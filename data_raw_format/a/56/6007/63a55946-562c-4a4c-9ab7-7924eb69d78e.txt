Biography: 
I have a special interest in big data and the potential to glean meaningful insights from them to inform decision making, especially in the field of science communication. I have a background in engineering and my research focuses on the use of machine learning to study the processes and outcomes of space and astrobiology related communications on social media. I am interested in using the knowledge and results gained from my analysis to develop intuitive and useful tools to help scientists communicate their research to the public.
