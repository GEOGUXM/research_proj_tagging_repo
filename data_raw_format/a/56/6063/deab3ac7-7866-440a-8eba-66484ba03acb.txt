L. Gabriel Navar, PhD
Professor and Chair
Co-Director, Renal & Hypertension Center
Phone: (504) 988-2594
Room #: 4002

Email: navar@tulane.edu
PhD: University of Mississippi, 1966
   


Research Interests:

Research programs in Dr. Navar's laboratory investigate hormonal and paracrine mechanisms regulating renal hemodynamics, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and sodium excretion. Intense activity is also focused on the pathophysiology of hypertension and the role of the intrarenal renin angiotensin system (RAS) in altering kidney function to lead to in angiotensin II dependent hypertension.


Laboratory Members:
Kayoko Miyada, PhD – Postdoctoral Fellow
Akemi Sato, MS – Medical Research Specialist
Dale Seth – Lab Supervisor
Weijian Shao, PhD – Medical Research Specialist
