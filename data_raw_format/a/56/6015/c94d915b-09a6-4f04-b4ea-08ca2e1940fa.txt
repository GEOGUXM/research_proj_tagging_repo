ADDICTIONS DEPARTMENT STAFF
Dr Patricia Conrod
PhD CPsychol
Clinical Senior Lecturer

Patricia Conrod is a BPS Chartered Clinical Psychologist and Seniour Clinical Lecturer in the Addictions Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King’s College London. She will join the Faculty of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, University of Montreal in September, 2010 and will be based at the CHU Sainte-Justine Mother and Child Hospital Centre.  Her research focuses on cognitive, personality and biological risk factors for the development and maintenance of drug abuse and the factors that mediate the co-occurrence of addictive behaviours with other mental disorders. Her experimental research focuses on factors that make people more susceptible to seek out behavioral reinforcement from drugs of abuse. She has published several studies demonstrating that personality factors determine the type of reinforcement experienced from substances of abuse. More recently, her research findings have led to the development of new approaches to substance abuse treatment and prevention that target personality risk factors and the underlying motivational determinants of drug use in subtypes of substance misusers.  Dr. Conrod is a member of the King’s College London Research Ethics Committee and Associate Editor of Current Reviews in Drug Abuse.
