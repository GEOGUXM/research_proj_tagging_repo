Chengjun Du is working on the ‘Spray Fundamentals’ project. His research mainly focuses on investing the effect of high injection pressure pressure and nozzle geometry on the non-combustion and combustion spray characteristics in an optical accessible high pressure / high temperature chamber under different ambient conditions. The overall goal is to better understand fuel/air mixture processes and combustion characteristics of a spray, in order to improve diesel combustion and reduce emissions from diesel engines. In addition, he also performed spray experiments using diesel-ethanol blends, and he is also interested in different optical technics to measure spray characteristics quantitatively.
