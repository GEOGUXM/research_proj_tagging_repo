OSU Environmental Chemistry Portal (for potential students)
Our research is focused in the field of environmental forensic chemistry which involves the application of chemical concepts to the interpretation, distribution, speciation, and bioavailability of chemicals in the environment (often litigious). We focus on persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic chemicals. We are working at several field sites, mostly throughout the state of Oregon, including the Portland Harbor Superfund Site, and several sites on the Willamette River. We work in several eco-system compartments: dominantly fish, surface waters and sediments. In addition, to classical techniques, we work on development and evaluation of in-situ techniques which mimic organisms, in order to better understand bioavailability. We also look at the effect of episodic events/inputs into an eco-system.
