Jodie Ririe
DEPUTY PERSONNEL MANAGER
My role in the Personnel Team is to provide HR and recruitment support within NDORMS, in particular to all staff based in the Botnar Research Centre. I am responsible for the recruitment of new staff and providing specialist advice and guidance on personnel procedures within the department.
I joined the department in 2013, and although my background is in Modern Language Studies, I have developed a passion for Recruitment and Personnel, so please feel free to seek my advice at any time!
