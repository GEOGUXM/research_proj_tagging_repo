Biography
Dr Anna M. Barnett is Senior Lecturer (equivalent to a tenured US Associate Professor) and Head of the Semiconductor Materials and Devices Laboratory at University of Sussex, UK.  She is an experimental physicist with interests in detector physics and instrumentation for space science and extreme terrestrial environments (high temperature, intense radiation).
Dr Barnett has particular expertise in the characterisation of novel semiconductor materials for photon counting spectroscopy of X-rays, gamma-rays and electrons/beta particles.  She conducts fundamental research on III-V (e.g. GaAs, AlGaAs, AlInP, GaN), SiC and diamond materials and devices for these and other purposes.
