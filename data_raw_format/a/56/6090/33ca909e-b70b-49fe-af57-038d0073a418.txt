Overview
Nitroso-redox disequilibrium is a common hallmark of many forms of cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in the United States. My research activities seek to define the underlying redox-sensitive signaling pathways and the mechanistic consequences of redox-based post-translational protein modifications in healthy and diseased myocardium. S-nitrosylation, which results from the addition of a nitric oxide moiety to a cysteine thiol, is one example of a redox-based modification that has been implicated as a critical regulator of many processes that govern normal cellular physiology, including protein function and stability, protein-protein interaction, and protein localization. 
To examine these modifications, my laboratory has developed several novel proteomic approaches to map specific cysteine modification sites and assess occupancy levels in the heart using mass spectrometry. My laboratory also utilizes additional cutting-edge methodologies, including site-directed mutagenesis and gene editing strategies, to further investigate the role of S-nitrosylation and other redox-based modifications in regulating protein function, stability and localization. Additional research efforts center on sex differences in S-nitrosothiol signaling, as well as elucidating the dynamics of protein S-nitrosylation including mechanisms for the addition and removal of the modification, target specificity, spatial localization, mechanistic consequences, and interplay with other redox-based modifications. A better understanding of protein S-nitrosylation and other redox-based modifications is critical for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies to effectively combat cardiovascular disease.
