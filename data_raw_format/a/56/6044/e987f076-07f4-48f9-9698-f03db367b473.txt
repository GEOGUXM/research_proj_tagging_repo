Selected Project Experience
Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, 2012-
2015: 
Darren directed the Gorge Commission’s 
work with neutral facilitators and a wide range of 
diverse interests to assess regional priorities and 
identify areas of shared interest for collaborative 
regional planning and policy. Through Darren’s 
leadership, the Commission worked closely with 
Oregon Consensus and the Ruckelshaus Center 
to reshape 25 years of internal and external 
contention into a constructive, forward-looking 
discussion about the long term health of Gorge 
resources and the long-term future of Gorge 
communities. The Commission is now using 
collaborative tools to improve internal relations 
and to strengthen its role as a collaborative 
regional planning agency.
Collaborative Public Planning, 2007-2011:
As the grants program manager for Oregon’s 
Department of Land Conservation and 
Development (DLCD), Darren worked with 
the Land Conservation and Development 
Commission’s (LCDC) grants advisory committee 
and with Oregon Consensus to increase funding 
for land use mediation services and produce a 
documentary video outlining a model public 
policy collaborative between ranchers, public 
agencies and environmental interests in Malheur 
County, Oregon. The video and the department’s 
investment in alternative dispute resolution tools 
informs and supports collaborative local and 
regional decisions across the state.
Information for Collaborative Decision Making, 
2006-present: 
Darren is committed to providing 
better information and innovative tools to help 
public and private decision-makers at all levels. 
During his tenure with the State of Oregon, Darren 
helped the department design and invest in an 
Information Management Modernization Initiative 
– a system of organizing and storing forty years of 
statewide natural resource, land use, conservation, 
community development, and infrastructure 
planning data in a publicly accessible library. The 
land use data will help current and future citizens, 
agency managers and elected officials make more 
informed (and hopefully more collaborative) 
decisions about the future of Oregon’s natural 
resources and communities.
Darren Nichols
Associate Director
Darren brings 12 years of public policy, land use planning and 
community development experience, including local, state and 
regional agency management experience. Prior to joining the 
Center, he served as Executive Director of the Columbia River Gorge 
Commission, a unique interstate compact agency between Oregon 
and Washington that was established by act of Congress to protect 
and enhance the scenic, cultural, recreational, economic and natural 
resources of the Columbia River Gorge.  While at the Commission, he 
worked closely with the bi-state regional community (two states, six 
counties, 13 urban and rural communities, four tribal governments, 
federal agencies and numerous other stakeholders and involved 
parties) to foster a collaborative dialogue about regional priorities and 
long-term stewardship of resources and communities. Darren has also 
worked with the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and 
served as a senior division manager and regional planner with the 
Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development.

Interagency Technology, Science and Policy Partnerships, 2012-2015: 
Under Darren’s leadership, the Gorge Commission and several partner organizations advanced the collaborative 
effectiveness of NW state and federal agencies through strategic partnerships with interdisciplinary monitoring, data 
management, science, and policy organizations. Darren convened colleagues at Washington State University’s School of 
the Environment, Portland State University’s School of the Environment, Oregon State University’s College of Forestry, 
the United States Geological Survey, United States Department of Energy, the United States Forest Service and others 
to jointly develop a shared information system concept. The resulting “decision support framework” is intended to 
collect monitoring data and apply scientific analyses from multiple agencies, and then feed that shared information 
into a collaborative planning and policy decision-making framework for the bi-state Columbia River Gorge National 
Scenic Area. The decision support framework may serve as a model for other agencies and regions interested in working 
together on collaborative public policy. Ultimately, the framework may serve as a model to inform the next generation 
of national environmental policy, incorporating consistent information and science into local, state, regional, tribal and 
federal agency decisions.
Administrative Assessment, 2014: 
Darren worked with the Evans School of Public Policy and Governance (University of Washington) and the Hatfield 
School of Government – Center for Public Service (Portland State University) to conduct a first-ever agency assessment 
of the Columbia River Gorge Commission. The assessment identified administrative opportunities and constraints, 
unique legal tools, and national comparisons to provide a series of recommendations for the future stability of the 
agency and the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area.
