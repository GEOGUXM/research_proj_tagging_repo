Contact details for Dr Donna Weston
From classically trained pianist to studies in audio engineering, to head of a popular music degree is not a usual career pathway, and yet this is exactly the path followed by Dr Donna Weston. She has a personal commitment to supporting all kinds of music, and is passionate about not valuing one more than another—as she says, ‘there are infinite music listeners, and musical venues, and circumstances in which music takes place; thank goodness there is plenty of music to suit all of them.’ With memberships and conference presentations for such groups as the International Association for the Study of Popular Music, the World Forum for Acoustic Ecology, and the International Council for Traditional Music, it is clear that Donna represents her own motto for the Conservatorium: we aren’t just all about music, we’re about all music.
