Research Interests
My research interests are directed towards leadership behaviors in Athletic Training Education. Specifically, I am interested in the leadership behaviors of the Program Director and how that affects the organizational health and well-being of the organization. I have developed a Program Director- Leadership Behavior Assessment Tool (PD-LBAT) that identifies the Personal Leadership, Program Leadership and People Leadership aspects of the Program Director.
