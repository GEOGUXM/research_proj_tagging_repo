LISA KABOT has been an adjunct faculty member since fall of 2010, teaching at the University Park Campus and the Virtual Academic Center. She teaches in the Children, Youth and Families Department as well as in field education, and served as an external field instructor. 
Kabot has more than 30 years of experience as a social worker, working primarily with adolescents and families. She has served as a program director in both residential and inpatient psychiatric settings. She has been clinical director in a school setting working with adolescents with emotional and behavioral problems, as well as the clinical director of an intensive outpatient program for adolescents with substance use issues. In addition, she has many years of experience as a supervisor of interns and has a particular interest in program development.
In all of these settings, Kabot has used family therapy as a cornerstone to treatment, believing that the family system has the strongest influence on the development of issues during the transition from childhood to adulthood, and is the greatest source of hope and strength leading to resiliency. She has maintained a private practice since 1989.
