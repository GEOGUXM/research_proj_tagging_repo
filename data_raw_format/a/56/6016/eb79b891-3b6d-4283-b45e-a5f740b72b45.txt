BIOGRAPHY
Dr. Hongyu Zhao is the Ira V. Hiscock Professor of Biostatistics and Professor of Statistics and Genetics, Chair of the Biostatistics Department and the Co-Director of Graduate Studies of the Inter-Departmental Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Yale University. He received his B.S. in probability and statistics from Peking University in 1990 and Ph.D. in statistics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1995. His research interests are the applications of statistical methods in molecular biology, genetics, drug developments, and personalized medicine.
Some of his recent projects include large scale genome wide studies to identify genetic variants underlying complex diseases (schizophrenia, bipolar, autism, and substance sbuse), biological network modeling and analysis, disease biomarker identification, genome annotations, microbiome analysis and systems biology study of herbal medicine. He has published over 430 articles in statistics, human genetics, bioinformatics, and proteomics, and edited two books on human genetics analysis and statistical genomics. He has trained over 70 doctoral and post-doctoral students, many of whom are holding tenured or tenure-track positions at major universities in the states and overseas.
Dr. Zhao is a Co-Editor-Elect of the Journal of the American Statistical Association Theory and Methods, and serves on the editorial boards of several leading statistical and genetics journals. He was the recipient of the Mortimer Spiegelman Award for a top statistician in health statistics under the age of 40 awarded by the American Public Health Association. His research has also been recognized by the Evelyn Fix Memorial Medal and Citation by UC Berkeley, a Basil O'Connor Starter Scholar Award by the March of Dimes Foundation, election to the fellowship of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.
