Mammalian cells possess complex and dynamic intracellular membrane systems. Many integral membrane proteins move between different membranes within the cell in order to perform their function. My lab is interested in the movement of proteins, particularly integral membrane proteins, between the trans Golgi network (TGN; at the exit of the Golgi apparatus) and the cell surface ...
