Biography
Peter Luetchford has an MA in Anthropology and Sociology (1986) from the University of Aberdeen. After living and working in Spain for many years, he came to study for his PhD at Sussex in 1996. Between 1998-1999 he carried out fieldwork on coffee and cooperatives in rural Costa Rica and he received his PhD in Social Anthropology in 2003.  Peter began teaching in the Department in 2002, and in 2004-5 held the Leach/Royal Anthropological Institute research fellowship, which led to a monograph on Fair Trade and coffee in Costa Rica. More recently he has pursued his research interests through an ESRC funded project into the politics of local food and organics in Europe. This included further periods of fieldwork in Andalusia, Spain.
