Lilli-Marie Pavka has been Webmaster at IBM Research – Zurich since 2003 and holds an SIZ degree in Web Publishing.
Her work includes database design on the Lotus Notes Domino Designer platform.
She joined IBM in 1988 as manager of the now defunct Publications group, a comprehensive manuscript copyediting and processing support service.
Lilli has developed a Technical Writing Workshop tailored specifically to the scientific and technical English-language writing needs of her IBM Research colleagues. She gives this workshop at the IBM Research – Zurich Lab twice a year and on request. Contact her directly for scheduling details. She is currently preparing an online version to be video-broadcast to other IBM Research locations.
Prior to joining IBM, Lilli was an English-language copyeditor for scientific and technical manuscripts at the Institute of Aeroelasticity of the German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR) in Göttingen, Germany, from 1979–1988.
