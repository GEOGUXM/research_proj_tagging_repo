I am a cognitive scientist interested broadly in the evolution of communication and social behavior.
In my interdisciplinary research, I investigate the many ways that acoustic structure in speech is shaped by communicative goals. I have examined a variety of vocal phenomena across diverse cultures including infant-directed speech, vocal emotion, laughter, and perceptions of physical strength. I have also studied female vocal attractiveness across the ovulatory cycle, how people use vocal signals to communicate pragmatically relevant information, and the production and perception of music.
