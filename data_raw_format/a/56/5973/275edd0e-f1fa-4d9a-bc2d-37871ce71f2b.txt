Profile: Jennifer Duprey-Colon
Associate Professor
Faculty
Department of Spanish and Portuguese Studies
    I am an associate professor of the literature, history and culture of the modern and contemporary Iberian Peninsula specifically the Catalan, Castilian and Galician traditions with research and teaching interests on Iberian intellectual history; transatlantic studies; comparative literature; critical and literary theory; cultural studies; gender studies; philosophical approaches to theater and visual studies. My recent work has been located at the intersections of the tradition of Spanish and Catalan Theater and particular instantiations of the dialectic of modernity. My research as a scholar of Iberian studies has a strong transatlantic component whose comparative dimensions I have been pursuing in both my scholarship and teaching.   I have a strong interest in transatlantic studies, not only because these are inherently interdisciplinary, but also because I am critically engaged with the very theorizations of the concepts such as “Transatlantic” and “Crossing” as these have historically created and continue to create ideological discourses around political and cultural relations in both sides of the Atlantic.  I am also a member of the graduate faculty in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at Rutgers New Brunswick.
