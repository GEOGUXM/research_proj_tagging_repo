Research and Clinical Interests
My area of research is focused on “personalized therapeutics,” i.e., the use of biomarkers to determine proper selection and dosing of drugs to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse reactions. Many future drugs will require biomarker testing prior to use on individual patients and clinical trials are needed to validate their use. In the area of pharmacogenomics, we are interested in drug dosing studies for warfarin, irinotecan, tamoxifen, phenytoin and lipid lowering drugs. We are also performing research on validating novel protein markers for cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, acute coronary syndromes and heart failure.
