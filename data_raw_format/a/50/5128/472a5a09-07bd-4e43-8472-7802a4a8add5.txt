Research interests
In his research Gibson investigates the role of ritual, narrative and memory in placemaking and imaginative planning in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. He currently runs Australian Research Council (ARC) research projects investigating: (a) the role of narrative in scenario planning; and (b) the mapping of cultural assets and feelings of emotional attachment in regional Australia. He is also Chief Investigator on ARC-funded projects investigating: (c) new pedagogical practices for indigenous schooling; and (d) the role of large public screens in the evolution of new understandings of the 'public sphere' in transnational contexts, particularly in the relationship between Australia and South Korea.
