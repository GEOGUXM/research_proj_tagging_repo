Research Interests:

My research focuses on reconstructing and modeling the biogeochemistry and dynamics of the oceans during the early Cenozoic ‘greenhouse’ world. Pasted on this background of high temperatures were multiple episodes of extreme, rapid, greenhouse-gas driven global warming events called ‘hyperthermals’ that may provide analogs for future global climate change. By combining geochemical records from deep ocean sediment cores with Earth system modeling, I investigate the drivers and consequences of carbon cycling on a warm Earth on timescales ranging from the geologically brief hyperthermals (tens of thousands of years) to multi-million year trends.

Recent funded projects:
1. High-resolution foraminiferal carbon and oxygen stable isotope stratigraphy of Eocene sediments from the North Atlantic IODP Expedition 342. 2. GENIE Earth system modeling of Paleogene hyperthermals.
