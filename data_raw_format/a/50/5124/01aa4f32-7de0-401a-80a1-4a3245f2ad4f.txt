Personal homepage
  Kirsten A Smith is a Research fellow working as part of the LifeGuide Team in CAHP in the Psychology Department.
   Originally from NE Scotland, I have an undergraduate degree in Psychology from University of St Andrews and a Masters’ degree in Information Technology from the University of Aberdeen. I am due to complete my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Aberdeen in November 2016.
At the University of Aberdeen, I have previously worked on the ASICA project, aimed at improving Skin cancer self-checking of patients successfully treated for Melanoma and improve diagnosis and treatment processes and the Portrait Project, aimed at creating a tablet-based snapshot of people with dementia’s prior lives for their carestaff to use to improve person-centred care.
My Phd ‘Improving Support for Informal Carers through Technology’ looks at how a computer application could provide better emotional support for carers, by providing personalised emotional support messages and mediating communication between the carer and their personal social network.
