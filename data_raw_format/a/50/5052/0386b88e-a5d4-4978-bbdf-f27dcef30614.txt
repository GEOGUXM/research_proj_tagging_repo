Biography.
Dr Walker spent eight years at De Montfort University, where her research and teaching focussed on renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies, and where she also completed a PhD part time. This PhD investigated the impact of electricity sector deregulation on renewable energy market share. During that period with De Montfort University, Dr Walker worked on a number of research projects around renewable energy and energy efficiency, primarily funded by the European Commission.
Dr Walker then moved out of academia and into industry, with a five year period in energy related consultancies. This consultancy work for Econnect and IT Power included contribution to the influential report “Potential for micro-generation: study and analysis” published by Energy Saving Trust for the DTI. Dr Walker also worked on high profile projects for commercial clients, such as London Array.
In 2007, Dr Walker joined Northumbria University and continued her research on renewable energy and energy efficiency. She also developed new programmes, including the MEng Building Services Engineering, and successfully ran programmes, managed staff and developed research and business outreach. Her first role was as Subject Director for the Building Services team. Following a restructure she took on the role of Director of Research and Engagement for the Department of Architecture, Construction and Engineering. Later she was promoted to a Faculty role, as Director of Business and Engagement for the Faculty of Engineering and Computing..
In September 2015 Dr Walker joined Newcastle University in the School of Mechanical and Systems Engineering. She is Degree Programme Director for the MSc Renewable Energy Flexible Training Programme (REFLEX) and MSc Renewable Energy and Enterprise Management (REEM).
