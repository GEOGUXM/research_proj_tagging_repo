  <p class="abstract">To evaluate the practice of empiric antibiotics for febrile, nonneutropenic pediatric oncology patients with a central venous catheter (CVC) in place.Episodes of fever without neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] â‰¥500 cells/mm(3)) were reviewed retrospectively in pediatric oncology patients with a CVC undergoing chemotherapy. Characteristics and symptoms were compared between patients with bacteremia and patients without bacteremia.A total of 392 episodes of nonneutropenic fever in 138 subjects (52 females; 38%) were reviewed. In this cohort, the median age at an episode was 7 years, and the majority of patients had a diagnosis of acute leukemia (54%). Median ANC was 3100 cells/mm(3) (IQR, 1570-5980 cells/mm(3)). Median temperature was 38.7Â°C (IQR, 38.3-39.2Â°C). Twenty-four infectious episodes (6%) occurred in 18 subjects, and 5 CVCs required removal; all patients requiring removal admitted and received antibiotics owing to chills. There were no significant difference in age, sex, or ANC between patients with bacteremia and those without bacteremia; however, mean temperature was higher in the patients with bacteremia (39.4Â°C vs 38.7Â°C; P = .003). No deaths due to sepsis occurred, and no CVCs were removed because antibiotics were not administered empirically.Our practice of observing pediatric oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy with CVCs who are not neutropenic does not appear to lead to increased serious adverse outcomes and avoids antibiotic exposure for &gt;90% of patients without a bacterial infection.</p>

  <p class="abstract">A 10-year-old boy was referred to our clinic for tonsillectomy and was found to have a large mass within his oropharynx. Intraoperative biopsies confirmed Burkitt lymphoma. Further imaging and biopsy revealed pancreatic involvement. He was treated with multiagent chemotherapy. He remains disease-free 6 years later. Review of the literature demonstrates other cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with pancreatic involvement with good outcomes. Pancreatic involvement is a relatively rare occurrence in childhood lymphoma.</p>

  <p class="abstract">Although group therapy is the most prevalent treatment modality for substance use disorders, an up-to-date review of treatment outcome literature does not exist. A search of the literature yielded 24 treatment outcome studies comparing group therapy to other treatment conditions. These studies fell into one of six research design categories: (1) group therapy versus no group therapy; (2) group therapy versus individual therapy; (3) group therapy plus individual therapy versus group therapy alone; (4) group therapy plus individual therapy versus individual therapy alone; (5) group therapy versus another group therapy with different content or theoretical orientation; and (6) more group therapy versus less group therapy. In general, treatment outcome studies did not demonstrate differences between group and individual modalities, and no single type of group therapy reliably demonstrated greater efficacy than others. Unique methodological and logistical hurdles encountered in research on group therapy for substance use disorders, as well as considerations for future research, are also discussed.</p>

  <p class="abstract">The current study evaluated the concurrent validity of requiring remission of undue influence of weight and shape on self-evaluation (undue influence) in defining recovery from bulimia nervosa (BN).Three groups completed the Beck Depression Inventory, the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire, the Body Shape Questionnaire, and the Social Adjustment Scale: 31 women were fully recovered from BN (FR), 28 women had no behavioral symptoms of BN (partially recovered [PR]), and 59 matched non-eating-disordered controls (MC).The PR group had more pathologic scores on depression, anxiety, body dissatisfaction, and social adjustment compared with both the FR and MC groups, which did not differ from each other.These findings suggest that including remission of cognitive symptoms in a standardized definition of recovery may prove to be clinically useful in establishing reliable prognostic indicators. Future research should evaluate the role played by cognitive symptoms in triggering relapse.</p>

Median temperature was 38.7Â°C (IQR, 38.3-39.2Â°C). Twenty-four infectious episodes (6%) occurred in 18 subjects, and 5 CVCs required removal; all patients requiring removal admitted and received antibiotics owing to chills. There were no significant difference in age, sex, or ANC between patients with bacteremia and those without bacteremia; however, mean temperature was higher in the patients with bacteremia (39.4Â°C vs 38.7Â°C; P = .003). No deaths due to sepsis occurred, and no CVCs were removed because antibiotics were not administered empirically.Our practice of observing pediatric oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy with CVCs who are not neutropenic does not appear to lead to increased serious adverse outcomes and avoids antibiotic exposure for >90% of patients without a bacterial infection.","apaCitation":"Bartholomew, F., Aftandilian, C., Andrews, J., Gutierrez, K., Luna-Fineman, S., &amp; Jeng, M.

Characteristics and symptoms were compared between patients with bacteremia and patients without bacteremia.A total of 392 episodes of nonneutropenic fever in 138 subjects (52 females; 38%) were reviewed. In this cohort, the median age at an episode was 7 years, and the majority of patients had a diagnosis of acute leukemia (54%). Median ANC was 3100 cells/mm(3) (IQR, 1570-5980 cells/mm(3)). Median temperature was 38.7Â°C (IQR, 38.3-39.2Â°C).
