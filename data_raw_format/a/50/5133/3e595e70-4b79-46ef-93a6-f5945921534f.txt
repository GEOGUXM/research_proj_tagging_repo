Mary Dalrymple
Professor Mary Dalrymple FBA
Professor of Syntax and Fellow of Linacre College
Research interests:
Syntax, semantics, information structure, prosody, grammatical architecture, language documentation.
Research profile:
My research centers mainly on syntax, the syntax-semantics interface, and semantics. I am particularly interested in the syntactic properties of human languages and how they can guide the process of assembling meanings of words and phrases into meanings of larger phrases and sentences.
