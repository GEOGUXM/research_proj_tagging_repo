I am a lecturer in the Climate Change Research Centre (CCRC) at UNSW and Associate Investigator with the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (ARCCSS). My science research is in understanding the role of the ocean in climate variability particularly through satellite oceanography but I also have interests in learning & teaching and knowledge transfer from the tertiary to secondary education sector, particularly with regards to promoting numeracy and the physical sciences.
