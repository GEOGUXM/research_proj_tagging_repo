Ciao! My name is Leandro Fiorin and since 2013 I have been working on the DOME project as post doctoral researcher at the ASTRON & IBM Center for Exascale Technology located in Dwingeloo, the Netherlands. Previously, I was a research associate at ALaRI, the Advanced Learning and Research Institute, part of the Faculty of Informatics of the Universita' della Svizzera italiana (University of Lugano) in Lugano, Switzerland.

My research interests include energy-efficient architectures and accelerators for high-performance and embedded computing systems, as well as Networks-on-Chips, Multiprocessor System-on-Chips, reconfigurable architectures, and hardware security for embedded system architectures.
