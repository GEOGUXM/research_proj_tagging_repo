Professor Helen Small is currently at work on a study of the defences for the humanities that have been most influential in the 19th and 20th centuries and still exert some persuasive power. The study has a dual purpose: to provide a historical account of the arguments, and test their validity for the present day. She is the Julia Aisbitt Fellow in English Literature at Pembroke College.
