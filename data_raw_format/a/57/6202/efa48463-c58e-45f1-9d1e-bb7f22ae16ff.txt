Assistant Professor Bidhan ("Bobby") Parmar teaches First Year Ethics and a Second Year elective on collaboration at the Darden School of Business. He was recently named one of the top 40 Business School professors under 40 in the world.
Parmar's research interests focus on how managers make decisions and collaborate in uncertain and changing environments to create value for stakeholders. His work helps executives better handle ambiguity in their decision making. His recent research examines the impact of authority on moral decision making in organizations. Parmar's work has been published in Organization Science, Organization Studies, Business & Society and the Journal of Business Ethics.
Parmar is a fellow at the Business Roundtable Institute for Corporate Ethics, Olsson Center for Applied Ethics and the Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University. Prior to teaching at Darden, Parmar taught at the UVA McIntire School of Commerce.
Parmar lives in Charlottesville with his wife and two daughters.
