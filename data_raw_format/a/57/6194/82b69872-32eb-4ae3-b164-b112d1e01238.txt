Research Overview
Dr. Ling’s research focuses on adeno-associated virus (AAV) virology, gene therapy and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). His laboratory has made contributions to the above fields including: identification of a novel function of the inverted terminal repeat in the AAV genome and a new method applied by AAV to reduce its endogenous gene expression; elucidation of cellular receptor/co-receptor for AAV serotype 3; development of human liver targeting recombinant AAV gene therapy vector; identification of small molecules isolated from TCM to enhance gene therapy outcome; and delivery of cytotoxic genes isolated from TCM for the purpose of cancer gene therapy. The current emphasis of Dr. Ling’s research is on combining the treatment of rAAV-based cancer gene therapy and of TCM for human hepatocellular carcinoma.
