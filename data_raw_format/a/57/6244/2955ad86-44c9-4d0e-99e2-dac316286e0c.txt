Biography
Colorado State University is the only educational institution in Colorado that offers an undergraduate degree in microbiology. Our undergraduate program is robust, with 250-300 majors enrolled each year; however, it is still small enough that faculty and staff can provide microbiology majors with individual attention and personal service. In addition to completing a rigorous curriculum, many of our undergraduates obtain experience working in a research laboratory. Students are currently working in laboratories on the main campus, at the Arthropod-Borne and Infectious Diseases Laboratory and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, both located on the Foothills Campus, and at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital.
