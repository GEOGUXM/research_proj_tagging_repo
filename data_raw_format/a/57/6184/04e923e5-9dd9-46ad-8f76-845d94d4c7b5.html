</h3><h2><a name="research">Research</a></h2>
Theoretical astrophysics, with emphasis on understanding the origin and evolution of
planetary systems, both extra-solar and solar.<p>
<!--Order-of-magnitude physics.<p>-->
Interested students should talk to me or the <a href="http://astro.berkeley.edu/~echiang/students/students.html">students with whom I collaborate.</a></p><p>
Topics of interest include:

<br>
<br>
(1) Protoplanetary Disks.
<br>
<br>
Disks of gas and dust surrounding young
stars provide the reservoirs from which
planets ultimately coalesce.
Spectra and images of these
systems from ultraviolet to millimeter
wavelengths are modelled to understand
their thermodynamic states and
accretion profiles.

<br>
<br>
(2) Extra-solar Planetary Dynamics.
<br>
<br>
Extra-solar planets evince
surprisingly small orbits, remarkably large
eccentricities, and/or strongly resonant behavior due
to mutual gravitational perturbations. We seek
to understand the dynamical processes that
shape these orbits.

<br>
<br>
(3) Extra-solar Debris Disks.
<br>
<br>
A number of optically thin disks of dust have been stunningly resolved 
around stars 10--1000 times younger than the Sun. Debris disks offer clues
regarding the endgame of planet formation. Imprinted in their structures may
be signs of active gravitational sculpting by nascent planets.

<br>
<br>
(4) The Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt.
<br>
<br>
Pluto has only recently been discovered to be
one of at least tens of thousands of asteroid-sized bodies
(Kuiper Belt Objects, or KBOs)
orbiting the outer Solar System. This ring
contains the most pristine, unprocessed
material in our planetary system
and holds clues to its
early evolution.


<br>
<br>
(5) Planetary Rings.
<br>
<br>
Rings furnish the most
accessible laboratories for disk dynamics;
they showcase a rich interplay of
forces due to interparticle collisions, self-gravity,
the gravity of shepherd moons, and
electromagnetic fields.

<!--Some of my happiest memories are from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/afs/athena.mit.edu/activity/d/dramashop/www/archive/1993-94/fob.html">this play</a> -->
The Berkeley Astronomy Department has a longstanding tradition of putting together an "Annual Play" every December to celebrate the holiday season. What makes our tradition unusual is that the faculty are held responsible for putting it together every three years (responsibility rotates between the faculty, students, and postdocs in a three-year cycle). I have been involved in writing and acting, and in several years directing, since 2003. I co-wrote and acted in the 2006 play. In 2009, I wrote a scene in which the arXiv server "cron" achieved sentience ("cron" became a recurring character in later years). I wrote, directed, cast, acted, and created the special effects for the <a href="play.pdf">2003 Faculty Play</a>, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmPNU9AFUZuA9nbVQLEqOVgs1urk1-hLGHXhjL4seAc/edit?usp=sharing">2012 Faculty Play</a>, and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nr05cJjQM33tSfDcNaCYe7Ri5E572g8QCgWNJKSeYIM/edit?usp=sharing">2015 Faculty Play</a> (the 2015 play was co-written with Aaron Parsons). I especially liked the <a href="holiday_play_2015_movie_only.m4v">video clip that I subtitled for the 2015 play</a>.
