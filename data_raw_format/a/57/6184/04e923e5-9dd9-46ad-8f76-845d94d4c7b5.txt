Research
Theoretical astrophysics, with emphasis on understanding the origin and evolution of planetary systems, both extra-solar and solar.
Interested students should talk to me or the students with whom I collaborate.
Topics of interest include:

(1) Protoplanetary Disks.

Disks of gas and dust surrounding young stars provide the reservoirs from which planets ultimately coalesce. Spectra and images of these systems from ultraviolet to millimeter wavelengths are modelled to understand their thermodynamic states and accretion profiles.

(2) Extra-solar Planetary Dynamics.

Extra-solar planets evince surprisingly small orbits, remarkably large eccentricities, and/or strongly resonant behavior due to mutual gravitational perturbations. We seek to understand the dynamical processes that shape these orbits.

(3) Extra-solar Debris Disks.

A number of optically thin disks of dust have been stunningly resolved around stars 10--1000 times younger than the Sun. Debris disks offer clues regarding the endgame of planet formation. Imprinted in their structures may be signs of active gravitational sculpting by nascent planets.

(4) The Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt.

Pluto has only recently been discovered to be one of at least tens of thousands of asteroid-sized bodies (Kuiper Belt Objects, or KBOs) orbiting the outer Solar System. This ring contains the most pristine, unprocessed material in our planetary system and holds clues to its early evolution.

(5) Planetary Rings.

Rings furnish the most accessible laboratories for disk dynamics; they showcase a rich interplay of forces due to interparticle collisions, self-gravity, the gravity of shepherd moons, and electromagnetic fields.

Personal
Born in New York 1973.
Married to Inn H. Yuk. Son Noah B. Chiang, born in Berkeley 2007.
The Berkeley Astronomy Department has a longstanding tradition of putting together an "Annual Play" every December to celebrate the holiday season. What makes our tradition unusual is that the faculty are held responsible for putting it together every three years (responsibility rotates between the faculty, students, and postdocs in a three-year cycle). I have been involved in writing and acting, and in several years directing, since 2003. I co-wrote and acted in the 2006 play. In 2009, I wrote a scene in which the arXiv server "cron" achieved sentience ("cron" became a recurring character in later years). I wrote, directed, cast, acted, and created the special effects for the 2003 Faculty Play, the 2012 Faculty Play, and the 2015 Faculty Play (the 2015 play was co-written with Aaron Parsons). I especially liked the video clip that I subtitled for the 2015 play.
