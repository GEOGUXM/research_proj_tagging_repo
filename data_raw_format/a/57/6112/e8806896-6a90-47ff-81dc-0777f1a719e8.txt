HONORARY DEPARTMENTAL CLINICAL LECTURER IN ORTHOPAEDICS
Paul Monk is the NIHR Academic Clinical Lecturer in Orthopaedics and Honorary Specialist Registrar in Trauma and Orthopaedics at Oxford University Hospitals. Paul holds grants from the Academy of Medical Sciences and Orthopaedic Research UK. He has secured intellectual property for musculo-skeletal ultrasound solutions, bespoke joint resurfacing methods and intra-operative devices and in 2013 he co-founded the Oxford Orthopaedic Evolutionary Group (OOEG) with Jonathan Rees and Fritz Vollrath.
Paul graduated from GKT School of Medicine, University of London in 2003 having previously obtained an honours degree in Medical Sciences and an MSc from the University of Leeds, with a focus on shoulder anatomy. After basic surgical training in New Zealand, Australia and Oxford he entered specialist Orthopaedic training in Oxford in 2009.
During higher surgical training he developed his research interests in sports orthopaedics, bespoke solutions for arthritic joints, dynamic musculoskeletal imaging and evolutionary medicine. This period of research resulted in the award of a DPhil (PhD) from St. Johns’ College, University of Oxford in 2011 with a thesis titled “The Patellofemoral Joint: Form and Function”.
