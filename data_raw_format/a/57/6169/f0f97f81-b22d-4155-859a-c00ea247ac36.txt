Research
My research interests are in computer vision and machine learning.  In general, the goal of computer vision is to develop the algorithms and representations that will allow a computer to autonomously analyze visual information. 

My primary interests are visual recognition and visual search.  Recent and ongoing projects in the group consider large-scale image/video retrieval, unsupervised visual discovery, active learning, active recognition, first-person "egocentric" computer vision, interactive machine learning, image and video segmentation, activity recognition, vision and language, and video summarization.
