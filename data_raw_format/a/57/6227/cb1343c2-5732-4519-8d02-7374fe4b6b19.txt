Zhaohua Yang
Zhaohua Yang received his Ph.D. from Stanford University. He specializes in tantric or esoteric Buddhism in middle period China; but his research interests also include Chan/Zen, indigenous scriptures, and the interactions between Buddhism and Daoism. In addition to his training in Dunhuang and pre-modern Japanese manuscripts, he has done extensive fieldwork in the Mainland China, Taiwan, Japan, and the US. He is working on a book manuscript tentatively entitled Devouring Impurities: the Rise of the Cult of Ucchuṣma in Pre-modern China, paying particular attention to responses to transgressive tantric practices in the cult of this sole surviving Wisdom King in China.
