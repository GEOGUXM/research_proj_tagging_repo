My research and teaching interests include: young people's cultural learning and development in multiple media environments and social contexts; media education and youth-media production and distribution for social change; popular media audience/user research; interpretative/ethnographic methodologies. I have publications in media, communication, anthropology, and education journals and edited anthologies. I am the author of Growing Up with Television: Everyday Learning Among Young Adolescents (2002, Temple U Press), and the editor of International Perspectives on Youth Media: Cultures of Production and Education (2011, Peter Lang Publishers, Inc.).
