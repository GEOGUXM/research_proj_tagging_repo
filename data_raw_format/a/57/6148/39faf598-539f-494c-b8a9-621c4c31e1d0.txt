About Us
The ECRU Haematology Trials Unit conducts both industry-sponsored and investigator –driven studies into pharmaceutical treatments for haematological conditions.
Over the last few years, our principle area of research has expanded from the treatment and prevention of venous thrombosis, to include the treatment of malignant and other non malignant blood conditions. The Unit is conducting studies in new treatment modalities for the following haematological conditions - all the leukaemias, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
In the last two years our team has worked together to randomise more than 200 patients into over 30 protocols at Eastern Health. We are also associated with both the Australian Centre for Blood Diseases and the Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group.
