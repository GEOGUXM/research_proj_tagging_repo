Research Interests
Rapid (non-genomic) actions of estrogens during aging and reproductive senescence.
Estrogen plays a fundamental role in neuronal physiology during aging, and declining estrogens at menopause increase the incidence of stroke, cognitive impairment and inflammation. While estrogen therapy (ET) is beneficial in young females or following surgical menopause, ET is detrimental in older, postmenopausal females. Our long term research goals are to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for age- and hormonal-related changes in cellular function that contribute to detrimental aging.  We utilize a rodent model of ovarian aging and menopause to test non-genomic estrogenic mechanisms that control calcium signaling and synaptic function against a background of long-term estrogen therapy and cognitive status. We utilize this rodent model coupled with a variety of techniques including, patch-clamp electrophysiology, measurements of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), laser confocal fluorescent microscopy, and single-cell reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (scRT-PCR). We focus on the rapid, non-genomic actions of estrogens and our experiments define how these actions are modulated by ovarian aging and ET. Identification of aberrant estrogen signaling will provide an important first step in identifying potential targets for future drug therapies.
