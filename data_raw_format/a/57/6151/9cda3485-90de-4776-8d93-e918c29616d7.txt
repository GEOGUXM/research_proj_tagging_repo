PRANAY JAIN
2016 - 2017
From:
India
Sector:
Agriculture
Location:
India
Pranay develops instruments that enable the dairy industry to ensure the quality and safety of milk procured from farmers in villages across India. These instruments improve the supply chain by simplifying and securing the process; they also support small and marginal dairy farmers, who receive fair and consistent payments and feedback on the quality of their produce. Thus the dairy industry can improve its product quality and quantity while it directly benefits local producers.
His venture is an outcome of Pranay’s passion for using technology to create a strong social and economic impact. In India, he has witnessed the severe lack of trust in dairy products resulting from several known instances of adulteration and spoilage. This has driven him to find solutions that can plug these gaps.
While a student at MIT, Pranay has developed several technologies, including the instruments for his present venture. Before MIT, he cofounded an Assistive Technology company in India. He also developed and sold educational tools for blind students across the globe. He has seven pending patents and has received several design and innovation awards.
Pranay earned an undergraduate degree in Production and Industrial Engineering from India Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi and a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from MIT. He is PhD candidate in the School of Engineering.
