SUMMARY
John Holt gained a BSc. hons Zoology at the University of Durham in 1979 and a Ph.D. in Entomology at the University of Southampton in 1983. He was a Post-doctoral Fellow at Imperial College from 1984 to 1987 and since then has had a long career with the Natural Resources Institute (NRI), University of Greenwich, where he is Reader in Resource Modelling. He currently works part-time for NRI and part-time for the Centre of Environmental Policy at Imperial. 
John has broad-based research interests in applications of modelling in natural resource management with particular experience in:
Infectious diseases of plants, particularly plant virus diseases and their insect vectors
Insect pest population dynamics and pest forecasting
Risk analysis and bio-security for pests and invasive species
He is working on a number of projects mainly concerned with the development of methods of risk assessment and risk management in plant health, biosecurity, bio-terrorism, GMO release and fishery sustainability.
