AIM: To examine the psychometric properties and criterion validity of the PHQ-9 to screen and detect depression in patients with CAD in Pakistan. DESIGN: In this validation study, 150 patients with CAD completed the Urdu version of the PHQ-9. The major depressive episode module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used as the gold standard. RESULTS: The Urdu version of the PHQ-9 revealed a good internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha of 0.83. Optimal sensitivity (76%) and specificity (76%) were achieved using the cut-off score of PHQ-9 6, with area under the ROC curve of 0.86.

The high prevalence of diabetes in Saudi Arabia makes this a particular priority for this country. AIM: The aim of this study was to examine nurses' perceived and actual knowledge of diabetes and its care and management in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A convenience sample of 423 nurses working in Prince Sultan Medical Military City in Saudi Arabia was surveyed in this descriptive, cross-sectional study. Perceived knowledge was assessed using the Diabetes Self-Report Tool, while the Diabetes Basic Knowledge Tool was used to assess the actual knowledge of participants. RESULTS: The nurses generally had a positive view of their diabetes knowledge, with a mean score (SD) of 46.9 (6.1) (of maximum 60) for the Diabetes Self-Report Tool. Their actual knowledge scores ranged from 2 to 35 with a mean (SD) score of 25.4 (6.2) (of maximum of 49). Nurses' perceived and actual knowledge of diabetes varied according to their demographic and practice details. Perceived competency, current provision of diabetes care, education level and attendance at any diabetes education programs predicted perceived knowledge; these factors, with gender predicted, with actual diabetes knowledge scores. CONCLUSION: In this multi-ethnic workforce, findings indicated a significant gap between participants' perceived and actual knowledge. Factors predictive of high levels of knowledge provide pointers to ways to improve diabetes knowledge amongst nurses.</span>  </div>    </div>

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify correlates of HRQoL in patients with MI. DESIGN: A literature review of the factors that affect HRQoL in patients with MI (1995-2016). DATA SOURCES: Three main databases-CINAHL, MEDLINE and PsychINFO-were searched to retrieve relevant peer-reviewed articles published in English. REVIEW METHODS: In consultation with a medical librarian, we identified relevant MeSH terms and used them for searching the literature: health-related quality of life/quality of life/HRQoL/QoL, myocardial infarction/heart attack/MI and predict*/factor. Data elements were extracted and narratively described variables synthesised into four categories. RESULTS: A total of 48 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Correlates of HRQoL in patients with MI were identified in the following categories: demographic, behavioural, disease-related, and psychosocial factors. Specific correlates included age and gender-identity for demographic factors; physical activity and smoking for behavioural factors; severity of MI, symptoms, and comorbidities for disease-related factors; anxiety and depression for psychosocial factors. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying correlates of HRQoL can help identify patients who are at risk for poor HRQoL in the recovery or rehabilitation stage of post-MI. Future intervention should focus on adjustable correlates such as behavioural and psychosocial factors to promote HRQoL among patients after experiencing MI.</span>  </div>    </div>

This study aimed to explore the lived experiences of nurse preceptors working with new nurses.This qualitative study used the hermeneutic phenomenological design to explore the experiences of six nurse preceptors working with new nurses in a tertiary pediatric teaching hospital in Northwest of Iran, who were recruited by purposive sampling. Data were collected using in-depth semi-structured individual interviews between July 2014 and March 2015, and analyzed using the Diekelmann's seven-stage method.Data analysis revealed three themes: 1) preceptorship as a challenging and stressful role; 2) lack of support; and 3) lack of appreciation. Preceptorship as 'a challenging and stressful role' was the constitutive pattern that unified the themes.The preceptorship of new nurses is challenging and stressful. Preceptors endure several roles concurrently, thus, their workload should be balanced appropriately in order not to compromise with one another and evade burnout. The preceptors need to be well supported and their contribution be appropriately recognized. Setting clear objectives and realistic expectations, and having clear policies and guidelines in place should help develop a preceptorship program that is more likely to bring about positive outcomes for both preceptors and new nurses.</span>  </div>    </div>

Included papers described interventions categorised as: 1) multifaceted; and 2) behavioural and educational, comprising: 2a) text message and mail message; 2b) telephone calls; 2c) motivational interviewing; and 2d) nurse-led counselling and education.Substantial heterogeneity limited the robustness of conclusions, but this review indicated that motivational interviewing, education and phone or text messaging appeared promising as means to enhance cardiac medication adherence. Future research should integrate multifaceted interventions that target individual behaviour change to enhance adherence to cardiovascular medications, to build on the beneficial outcomes indicated by this review.

Gastrectomy affects different aspects of functionality and impacts on the quality of life (QoL) of patients with gastric cancer. The importance of appropriate assessment of QoL in cancer patients is well established, yet strategies that help improve this important patient outcome are relatively scarce.
OBJECTIVE:
To examine the effectiveness of a brief self-care education program to improve QoL of gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy.
METHODS:
Using a randomized controlled trial, 59 patients with gastric cancer and candidate for gastrectomy were randomly assigned either to an intervention group (n = 31) to participate in a brief self-care education program or to a usual-care group (n = 28). Data were collected on patient demographics, and QoL was measured by the QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-STO22 at baseline and 1 month after gastrectomy.
RESULTS:
There were no statistically significant between-group differences in any subscales of the QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-STO22. However, participants in the brief self-care education program showed significant improvements from baseline in the global health status-QoL scale (t = 2.243,    &lt; .05), experience of pain (t = 2.508,    &lt; .05), constipation (t = 2.773,    &lt; .05), and the experience of dysphagia at the follow-up assessment.
LIMITATIONS:
This study is likely to be underpowered to show differences between the groups.
CONCLUSION:
A brief self-care education program was not sufficient to significantly improve the quality of life patients with gastric cancer after gastrectomy.</span>  </div>    </div>

A deep understanding of patient experiences of care and the way a treatment can affect their everyday life is particularly important in chronic disease management. The aim of this study is to explore experiences that patients undergo after angioplasty. Using a phenomenological study design, 15 patients participated in an individual face-to-face semi-structured interview. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The following core themes emerged from the analysis, which reflect the experiences of patients post angioplasty: a) angioplasty: a milestone in the patients life; b) living with a mended heart; and c) psychological distress as an integral part of the patients life. Participants after angioplasty went through both positive and negative changes in their life. Understanding of these experiences are essential to modify the high risk behaviours while also support the patients through their rehabilitation.</span>  </div>    </div>

Method: PsychInfo, CINAHL, PubMed, and Google were searched for pertinent evidence linking depression, culture, and CHD, and retrieved articles were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Findings: Identified themes were the followings: depression is a factor in development and prognosis of CHD and affects the capacity to self-manage and adhere to treatment recommendations; culture mediates mental health/illness representations and treatment-seeking behaviors; screening and assessment of depression can be affected by cultural factors; and there is a need for culturally appropriate screening and therapeutic strategies. Discussion and Conclusions: As depression is a predictor and moderating variable in the genesis and progression of CHD, understanding how factors such as culture affect screening and management of the disease is important to inform the development of culturally and linguistically competent strategies that ensure accurate screening, detection, and treatment of depression in cardiac patients in clinical practice.</span>  </div>    </div>

Little evidence exists about the Iranian infertile women's viewpoint regarding gestational surrogacy. Aim: To assess the viewpoint of Iranian infertile women toward gestational surrogacy. Setting and Design: This descriptive study was conducted at the infertility clinic of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Materials and Methods: The study sample consisted of 238 infertile women who were selected using the eligible sampling method. Data were collected by using a researcher developed questionnaire that included 25 items based on a five-point Likert scale. 0 Statistical Analysis: Data analysis was conducted by SPSS statistical software using descriptive statistics. 0 Results: Viewpoint of 214 women (89.9%) was positive. 36 (15.1%) women considered gestational surrogacy against their religious beliefs; 170 women (71.4%) did not assume the commissioning couple as owners of the baby; 160 women (67.2%) said that children who were born through surrogacy would better not know about it; and 174 women (73.1%) believed that children born through surrogacy will face mental problems. Conclusion: Iranian infertile women have positive viewpoint regarding the surrogacy.

This article describes the theoretical foundation of risk perception as a key component of changing deleterious health behaviours associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Furthermore, perception in increasing cardio- vascular risk-reducing behaviours in a socio-cultural framework is discussed, and an empirical development conceptual model presented. Background. Perception of risk is strongly linked with health-seeking behaviours. Understanding how to reduce risk and maximise cardiovascular health is an increasing focus of clinicians, researchers and policy makers. Increasing cultural diversity in contemporary society means that nurses need to develop and evaluate interventions in this context. Design. An integrative literature review. Method. An integrative literature review method was used to assess conceptual models relating to risk perception of developing CVD. On the basis of the findings, a model was developed to inform future intervention studies, considering individual, social and cultural factors. Discussion. Studies examining CVD and health behaviours report that there is limited concordance between actual and per- ceived risk in people with CVD. This mismatch risk likely impedes the adoption of risk-reducing behaviours. Conclusion. There is a critical need to develop interventions for enhancing an accurate perception of CVD risk considering not only individual but social factors. Relevance to clinical practice. There is limited correlation between knowledge and behaviours, and health behaviours are influenced by individual, social and cultural factors. Appraising the congruence between actual and perceived risk is an important step in developing effective care plans to reduce cardiovascular risk.</span>  </div>    </div>

This study was designed to validate the CDS in an Iranian population. Methods:  Translation and back translation of the 26- Item CDS scale was performed using recommended procedures. The Iranian translation of the CDS (I-CDS) was administered to 261 individuals in Iran, concurrently with the Beck Depression Inventory. The factor structure of the I-CDS was examined using exploratory factor analysis procedures to enable comparison with previous psychometric evaluation of the CDS. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to examine the ability of the I-CDS to discriminate between categories of depression. Results: First-order exploratory factor analysis uncovered two robust factors, consistent with the second-order dimensions originally reported by the developers of this instrument. Cronbach&amp;acirc;s alpha was 0.88 for the total 26-item I-CDS, indicating satisfactory internal consistency of the I-CDS. Intercorrelation between the total scores for the I-CDS and BDI was 0 .62 (P&lt; .001). For the I-CDS cut off of 90, the sensitivity was 85%, and specificity was 61% with a computed area under the curve (AUC) of .81 (95% CI, .76- .87). For the I-CDS cut off of 100, the sensitivity was 81% and specificity was 63% with a computed AUC of .81 (95% CI, .76- .87).

This paper describes cultural competence issues within the scientific and scholarly discourse surrounding cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Background. CR is an important secondary prevention strategy, improving health-related outcomes and reducing the risks of subsequent cardiovascular events. Internationally, it is widely accepted as a discrete health service model and is endorsed by government and professional bodies. Over past decades, low participation rates in CR remain a concern, particularly among minority groups and culturally and linguistically diverse populations. Design. Systematic review. Methods. Search of electronic databases. Conclusions. Few studies to date have described cultural competence in CR service design and as a consequence, there are minimal data to assist CR professionals and policy makers in tailoring health service delivery models. The limited scholarly debate and discussion regarding cultural competence in the CR literature limits the development and evaluation of culturally appropriate interventions. Relevance to clinical practice. There needs to be greater attention to the concept of cultural competence, both in practice and research settings, to ensure access to CR for people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.</span>  </div>    </div>

There is some evidence to support steroid therapy in the treatment of severe abdominal pain, severe nephritis, and central nervous system involvement. However, the routine use of corticosteroids is controversial. Frequent relapses, lack of response to steroid, steroid dependency, and steroid side effects may occur in some patients. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) gains increasing popularity in the treatment of autoimmune disorders, but hitherto, the available evidence to support the use of MMF in HSP is limited to some case study reports. Case Presentation. We report six children with HSP who failed to respond to systemic steroid therapy, whereas MMF successfully treated the manifestations of the disease. Conclusion. The manifestations of HSP disappeared mainly during the first week of treatment with MMF and all the patients were in a complete remission at the end and after discontinuation of the therapy. In our experience, MMF appeared to be safe and effective for the maintenance of remission in the HSP patients.</span>  </div>    </div>

Objectives: This study examined the location and magnitude of coronary artery blockages in patients admitted to a hospital with symptoms of coronary artery disease (CAD).  Setting: A leading tertiary heart hospital, Iran  Design &amp; Methods: This is a retrospective, descriptive study aimed to review angiography records of all patients with symptoms of CAD undergone diagnostic coronary angiography between February 2002 and September 2004. A total of 94 consecutive angiographic records were analyzed to determine the culprit coronary arteries and the severity of CAD.    Results: Double- vessel disease was the commonest type of CAD. The left anterior descending (LAD) artery was the most common culprit artery (84%), followed by RCA (64%), CX (37%), OM (13%) and LMS (3%).   Conclusion: Our study showed a relatively high angiographic prevalence of LAD blockages. The results of this study provide additional support for the significance of ethnicity in the extent of coronary artery blockages.</span>  </div>    </div>

The aims of this study were to explore the causal attributions of risk factors for CHD and to describe the relationship between their physiological status and causal attributions among immigrant Arabic, Turkish, and Iranian women living in Australia. Methods: Fifty-five women of Turkish, Iranian, and Persian backgrounds were recruited from community groups in metropolitan Sydney using snowball sampling and the assistance of bilingual health care workers. Body weight and blood pressure were assessed, and a questionnaire, including investigator-developed instruments and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, was administered. Health interpreters assisted with study procedures and translation of study instruments. Results: There was a low level of awareness of the risk of heart disease among women, although participants had knowledge of risk factors for heart disease broadly. The most highly attributed risk factors for CHD among participants were obesity, physical inactivity, and psychological distress. Women who rated highly on psychological distress scores were more likely to attribute negative emotions as causative factors for heart disease. Conclusions: Strategies to promote the awareness of the association between heart disease and women are required among migrant women. Further investigation is required to overcome the barriers to engaging in effective risk minimizing behaviors for heart disease.</span>  </div>    </div>

Clinicians in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) are well placed to assess and facilitate management of symptoms of depression, yet the timing and interpretation of measurements remain unclear. Metods: We administered the Hare-Davis Cardiac Depression Scale (CDS) in a usual care, outpatient CR program in a metropolitan setting. As part of routine assessment and monitoring of outcomes in a 6-week outpatient CR program, we administered the CDS at entry, at completion of the 6-week program, and at 12 months. Results: Data were available on 151 patients for the 3 measurement points. At baseline, the mean CDS score was 76.07 (22.38), which dropped at 6 weeks to 64.85 (21.69) but increased slightly at 12 months to 69.79 (24.36). The changes in these scores were statistically significant for all measurement points (P &lt;.03). The trend of change for the CDS was reflected in the subscale scores, which dropped at 6 weeks but increased slightly at 12 months. Discussion: Findings demonstrate a positive impact of CR on CDS scores at 6 weeks and 12 months, although there was a trend for increased scores at 1 year. This observation requires further investigation and underscores the importance of longitudinal studies.</span>  </div>    </div>

Knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, relating to both illness and wellness, are strongly influenced by culture and ethnicity, impacting upon an individual's capacity to engage in self-care behaviours. Effective management of HF is largely dependent on facilitation of culturally informed, self-care behaviours to increase adherence to both pharmacological and non- pharmacological strategies. The understanding the cultural experiences of individuals with chronic heart failure (CHF) in South East Health (DISCOVER) study is an exploratory, observational study investigating health patterns, information needs and the adjustment process for overseas-born people with HF living in Australia. An integrative literature review was augmented by qualitative data derived from key informant interviews, focus groups and individual interviews. A key finding of this study is that culture provides an important context to aid interpretations of attitudes, values, beliefs and behaviours, not only in illness but in health. While individual differences in attitudes and beliefs were observed among participants, common themes and issues were identified across cultural groups. Data from the DISCOVER study revealed the primacy of family and kinship ties. These relationships were important in making decisions about treatment choices and care plans.</span>  </div>    </div>

This integrated literature review seeks to identify the key considerations in conducting focus groups and discusses the specific considerations for focus group research with culturally and linguistically diverse groups. Background. The focus group method is a technique of group interview that generates data through the opinions expressed by participants. Focus groups have become an increasingly popular method of data collection in health care research. Although focus groups have been used extensively with Western populations, they are a particularly useful tool for engaging culturally and linguistically diverse populations. The success of focus groups in this context is dependent upon the cultural competence of the research team and the research questions.</span>  </div>    </div>
