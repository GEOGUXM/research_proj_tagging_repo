Ida is a doctoral student at the Division of Water Environment Technology at Chalmers. Ida works in a project in Cochabamba, Bolivia where the development of sustainable water and sanitation infrastructure in low income areas is supported.
The existing water and sanitation systems will be investigated together with local collaboration partners through case studies. The purpose is to understand how and why different water and sanitation solutions spread in order to enable the use of sustainable urban water use.
