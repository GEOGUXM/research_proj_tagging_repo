Research Interests
My research agenda is located within the areas of higher education and Indigenity. In particular, I am interested in the intersections between student affairs and services, recruitment and retention, Indigenous peoples, and student success in post-secondary education. I am also passionate about expanding understanding of Indigenous research processes and research ethical protocols. Theoretically, my work is influenced by Indigenous theory, social reproduction theory, and retention theories. This research agenda with the goal of empowering Indigenous success focuses on university and college responsibility and accountability to Aboriginal higher education from policy to practice.
