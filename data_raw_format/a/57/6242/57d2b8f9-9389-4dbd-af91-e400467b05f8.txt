Academic Interests
Dr. Lang's research interests are transcriptional regulation in normal development, stem cell regeneration and repair, and in disease progression. She has a specific interest in the transcription factor Pax3. Pax genes have primary roles in lineage specification and organogenesis during development and these functions may be duplicated in stem cell niches. Pathogenesis can represent a subversion of normal developmental signaling cascades and a return to an embryonic-like state. Unraveling the mysteries of normal development, differentiation and stem cell biology will lead to therapies for genetic based disease as well as stem cell based tissue regeneration.
