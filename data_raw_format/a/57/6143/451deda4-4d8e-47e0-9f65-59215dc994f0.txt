Nitrogen transformations in estuarine and coastal sediments
My research looks at nitrogen and carbon cycling in aquatic systems, with a main emphasis in benthic sediments.
Primary production can be nitrogen limited in aquatic systems, hence, it is important to understand nitrogen removal pathways in these systems. Until recently, removal of nitrogen was thought to occur solely by heterotrophic denitrification, but the discovery of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) has required us to reconsider the way we view nitrogen cycling.
I have been involved with anammox research since its discovery and this forms a major part of my research. Whilst my research was always either marine or estuarine based I have been investigating nitrogen cycling in lowland rivers, including the capacity of macrophytes to filter and process organic matter. Beyond this I am interested in aquatic sources of nitrous oxide and have been looking at novel pathways for the formation of N2O in the Arabian Sea (which is a very large source of N2O).
I am also seeking to further understand the impact of anthropogenic activities in coastal seas by looking at the links between primary and secondary production in the western Irish Sea and the impacts of trawling in the North Sea.
