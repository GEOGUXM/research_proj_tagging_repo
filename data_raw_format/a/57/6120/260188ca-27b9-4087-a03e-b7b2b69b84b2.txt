Ms Emma Lester is Education and Student Experience Adviser within Southampton Bussiness School at the University of Southampton.
  I joined the Education and Student experience team in 2012 and have been working on projects involving internal and external groups including companies such as PWC, Deloitte and Citibank as well as alumni and central university outreach.
I liaise between staff and students to enhance students experience studying Businesst School subjects. I also run our undergraduate buddy scheme which supports incoming 1st years and our peer adviser programme which supports our MSc students.
Having graduated from this University in 2011 I wish to use my knowledge and enthusiasm for the University of Southampton to help current students.
