About Me 
Ivan H. El-Sayed, MD, is Professor of Clinical Otolaryngology and the Director of the Otolaryngology Minimally Invasive Skill Base Surgery program and center in the Department of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery (OHNS) at the University of California, San Francisco. As of 2015, he has been elected to the North American Skull Base Society Directors Board, and he is recently named the Vice Chair of the American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Skull Base Committee. He has also been the Co-Course Director for Stryker-UCSF Resident Skull Base Approaches Course since 2009. Dr. El-Sayed completed his medical degree and internship from Boston University School of Medicine in Massachusetts. He completed his otolaryngology residency from Boston University, followed by a head and neck surgical oncology fellowship from UCSF. He lectures nationally and internationally on various topics related to head and neck oncology.
Dr. El-Sayed’s clinical focus is skull base surgery and he has developed the minimally invasive program into a nationally recognized program along with his neurosurgical colleagues. The program and center offers a unique capability of providing both endoscopic and open approaches to tailor the approach to the lesion. He has a broad surgical experience having performed over 500 surgical procedures on tumors of the nasal cavity/paranasal sinuses, infratemporal fossa, skull base and pituitary glands in over a decade of experience. He is also interested in the outcomes of research and clinical innovations through novel approach development. His research program goal is to develop 1) novel endoscopic surgical approaches and 2) nanotechnologies as multifunctional theranostic devices for the detection, destruction, and monitoring of oral cancer.
Dr. El-Sayed has published as first or senior author on topics in literature including skull base repair, endoscopic approaches to the maxilla and infratemporal fossa, surgical planning and approaches to the clivus and craniovertebral junction, as well as lesions of the clivus and sella. He is a reviewer for a variety of scientific journals, and he has contributed to over 50 peer-reviewed articles, 10 book chapters, and 2 patents. As of 2015, his work has been cited over 11,000 times in the literature.
Specialty:
Head and Neck Surgical Oncology, Minimally Invasive Skull Base Surgery, Salivary Gland Surgery, Sinus Surgery and Rhinology (tumors)
Expertise:
Skull base malignancy, oral cancer, paranasal sinus tumors, parapharyngeal space tumors (schwannomas, carotid body tumor, paraganglioma), oral cancer, parotid gland cancer, advanced skin cancers, tumors of the paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, clivus, and endoscopic surgery
Professional Interests:
Oral cancer, tumors of the salivary gland, neck and jaw and skull base surgery. Skull base surgery is a branch of head and neck oncology. Dr. El-Sayed’s research interests is in developing, techniques to treat oral cancer with nanotechnology and minimally invasive surgical approaches to remove tumors from complex anatomic regions in the skull base which include the parotid gland, the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, the parapharyngeal space and infratemporal fossa (which includes mandibular tumors, salivary tumors, schwannomas, carotid body tumor, paragangliomas etc). A variety of tumors occur in the nasal cavity that may require endoscopic surgery or an open surgical approach such as sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic cancer, esthesioneuroblastoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, sinonasal melanoma, recurrent nasopharynx cancers, and others. Several nonmalignant tumors occur in this area that are amenable to endoscopic resections such as juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma and inverted papilloma. Dr. El-Sayed frequently cares for patients requiring multidisciplinary teams such as otologic surgery for tumors involving the temporal bone, and neurological surgery for tumors crossing into the intracranial cavity. Dr. El-Sayed also is expert in closure of defects of the skull base (CSF leaks)
