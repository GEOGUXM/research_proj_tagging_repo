Our Research
Immunology is the science of the study of the immune system. Over millions of years, the immune system has evolved to preserve the barriers between self and non-self. Through an intricate system of pathways, molecules and cells present in every tissue of the body, the immune system protects us from pathogens. However, a disregulated immune system is also implicated in many diseases such as diabetes, lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. By understanding the immune system we can improve vaccination, control autoimmunity and prevent or reverse infectious diseases and cancer. Learn More >
