Short presentation
My part-time position (15%) at Uppsala University is mainly devoted to lecturing on the theory and reality of Building Conservation from the architect's point of view. The teaching is on graduate and post graduate level. Beside this, I am involved, again as an architect, in a couple of our inter-disciplinary research projects on sustainability and energy saving.
As Chief Architect of the Royal Palace in Stockholm, the rest of my working time is devoted to it's continuos conservation.
