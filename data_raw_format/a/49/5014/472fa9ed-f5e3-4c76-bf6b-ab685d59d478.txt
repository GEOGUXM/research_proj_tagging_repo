Research
I am currently working on a study of the borrowing and lending habits of Matthew Patten, a New England farmer of the eighteenth century.  This work will use his personal diary and accounts to examine the distinction between commercial and neighborly obligations in the pre-industrial world. By uncovering his rules of repayment, I hope to add to our understanding of early modern economic culture.
