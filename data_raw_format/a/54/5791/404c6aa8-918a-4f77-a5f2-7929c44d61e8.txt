  The Regulation of Golgi and Centrosome Dynamics in Mammalian Cells – We are interested in how organelles of the pericentriolar region communicate with each other. In mammalian cells, Golgi membranes are positioned in close proximity to the centrosome, the major microtubule organizing center of a cell. This specific localization is only seen during interphase as Golgi membranes are fragmented and dispersed throughout the cytosol during mitosis.
Another organelle that is positioned in this region of an infected cell is the inclusion, a membrane-bound compartment in which the bacterium, Chlamydia, resides and replicates. As an obligatory intracellular parasite, Chlamydia has extensive, but often poorly characterized interactions with its host.
Major projects in the lab:
The functional link between the Golgi and the centrosome in mammalian cellsWe found that the Golgi protein, GM130, controls the organization and function of the centrosome. This regulatory pathway involves Cdc42 and its specific activator, Tuba, which both localize to the Golgi. We are in the process of characterizing this regulatory pathway through interactor screens, small compound screens and functional assays. We are also interested in analyzing other regulatory pathways by which these two organelles communicate.
Host-pathogen interactions that affect Golgi and centrosome organization and functionWe are interested in how infections with Chlamydia sp. alter intracellular protein transport.We found that specific cell surface proteins are rerouted to the chlamydial inclusion and wish to determine the mechanism by which this bacterium modifies protein transport and sorting in the secretory pathway.We are also investigating the mechanism by which chlamydial infections induce centrosome abnormalities that may represent the critical the link between this intracellular bacterium and cervical cancer.
