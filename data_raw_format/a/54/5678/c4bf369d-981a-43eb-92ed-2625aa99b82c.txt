Dr. Jeffrey Runge specializes in companion animal surgery as well as various exotic species. He focuses primarily on laparoscopic and thoracoscopic minimally invasive surgery, and has lectured on single port and multiport laparoscopic surgery alike. Through ongoing collaboration with leading human laparoscopic surgeons, Dr. Runge and the University of Pennsylvania, School of Veterinary Medicine have become one of the leaders in veterinary reduced port surgery. By utilizing newer human laparoscopic single site techniques such as Single Port Access (SPA), Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS), and Laparoendoscopic Single-Site Surgery (LESS), Dr. Runge’s group continues to minimize minimally invasive surgery for today’s companion animals.
