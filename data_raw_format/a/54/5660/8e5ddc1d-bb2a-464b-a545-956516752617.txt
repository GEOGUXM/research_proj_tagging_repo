Summary
My research and teaching interests are in cardiovascular epidemiology and preventive medicine, including time trends in cardiovascular disease and determinants of cardiovascular disease risk factors in populations. 
As principal investigator of the ARIC and MESA studies, my work involves many facets of cardiovascular health, including atherosclerosis, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation, sleep disorders, the role of genetics, and more.
