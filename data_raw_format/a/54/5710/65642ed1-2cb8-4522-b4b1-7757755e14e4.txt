RESEARCH STATEMENT
Research Interests
The primary research interests of Dr. Chan are laser welding/joining and laser surface engineering for high value manufacturing applications. Up to the present, Dr. Chan has published more than 30 journal/conference papers in laser welding/joining/surface engineering. In addition to his laser research profile, Dr. Chan also conducted fundamental and applied research in the fields of Taguchi method/design of experiments, shape memory alloys, materials characterisation, and corrosion/stress-corrosion/corrosion-fatigue monitoring. 
  Below is a list of Dr. Chan's research expertise:
-Laser Welding/Joining of Materials (Metals, Plastics and Composites)
-Laser Surface Engineering of Metals
-Shape Memory Alloys
-Corrosion/Stress-corrosion/Fatigue-corrosion Monitoring
-Taguchi Method/Design of Experiments
-Materials Characterisation 
  Academic Background
Dr. Chi-Wai Chan has 10 years' experience in laser materials processing. He joined the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Queen's University Belfast (QUB) as a Lecturer/Assistant professor in August 2013. He obtained his MPhil and PhD in laser welding of NiTi shape memory wires from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and has been a visiting researcher at the University of Lincoln during which he worked on the application of laser surface engineering to modulate stem cell responses on NiTi alloys for orthopaedic applications. Apart from his academic experience, Dr. Chan has two-year industrial experience in China working as a Project Engineer for surface engineering of metals and alloys.
  Industrial-based and Multidisciplinary Research 
Dr. Chan recognises the impact of dissimilar materials joining to enable a lighter, cheaper and multifunctional next generation industrial products/applications. Therefore, he is collaborating with internal research centres and external industrial partners to build up the research base on laser dissimilar materials joining at QUB. Furthermore, Dr. Chan is actively working on the multidisciplinary research in healthcare technology by collaborating with national and international researchers with different backgrounds, such as laser physics, cell biology, pharmacy, surface science and tribology. The ultimate aim is to translate the laser surface engineering research from laboratory to industrial applications using a bottom-up approach, i.e. building up from a sound scientific understanding on laser-materials-cells interactions. 
  Ongoing Research and Projects
1) Laser dissimilar materials joining of metals to metals, metals to plastics, and metals to composites for biomedical/aerospace/automotive applications;
2) Laser surface engineering of bio-metals/-alloys for next generation orthopaedic applications, i.e. creating surface micro/nano-features to modulate stem cell responses and enhance antibacterial properties of implant surfaces.
 TEACHING
Dr. Chan is the international student support tutor of the School, with the aims to create a stronger bonding between students from different countries and backgrounds, and to maximise their learning experience at QUB. He is passionate in teaching the manufacturing and product design related subjects. He is responsible for teaching the MEE1027 Engineering Design 1.
 PARTICULARS
Dr. Chan is a committee member of the internationaisation team in the School and responsible for the matters of Hong Kong region, China. He is also the advisor of the Hong Kong Internationalisation Society at QUB (https://www.facebook.com/QUBHKIS/?fref=ts)
