Anthropology is a holistic study of the human species, past and present.  Anthropological inquiry ranges from the scientific (from genomics to pollen analysis) to the humanistic (from poetry to human rights). This is because people are neither simply biological organisms, nor are they purely social cultural beings, obliging anthropologists to take an eclectic approach to study humans. Although it would be most accurate to say that anthropology is    multi-field,    accommodating a wide range of research topics, methods, and theoretical approaches, the discipline (particularly in the U.S.) tends to follow traditional divisions into four intellectual subfields  cultural, linguistic, archaeological, and biological. Below we have provided a rough guide to what you will need to consider as you begin to launch your career as an anthropologist. Students interested in  pursuing graduate work in anthropology should first consider what thematic or topical area they are interested in studying, and evaluate graduate programs based on the expertise of the faculty in these areas. Applicants with a well-defined area of interest are more competitive for admission to graduate programs than those with little preparation and or poorly defined interests!     (See  Application Advice) Because you will likely be applying (or have already applied and been accepted) to graduate school as a practitioner of a particular anthropological subfield, we have taken the liberty of providing advice tailored to three of the four subfields (cultural, archaeological, biological). It is important to keep in mind that in all cases, anthropology is a demanding field that is writing intensive. Our strongest recommendation is to develop robust skills in written communication and analysis.   Also, as in any professional academic pursuit, critical thinking and argumentative skills are essential to research, all of which graduate school will help you hone and master.   The most competitive applicants to graduate programs can demonstrate independent research ability and strong preparation for their area of interest as outlined below.  accordion   toggle title= Cultural Anthropology   Cultural anthropologists tend to pursue specialization in a particular thematic area (such as medical anthropology, political and legal anthropology, or environmental anthropology) as well as a regional area (such as Latin America, Southern Africa, or Eastern Europe). Students should realistically consider with what population, and in which part of the world, they might conduct fieldwork. Coursework in the relevant languages, regional history, and cultural geography is necessary at the graduate level and highly recommended at the undergraduate level. Depending on the specific nature of their interests, students should also consider pursuing undergraduate coursework in areas such as epidemiology, gender ethnic relations, international development, writing, and research methods (qualitative and quantitative). Students with previous coursework and or an undergraduate degree in anthropology (or a closely related field, such as geography, history, sociology, or political science), international travel experience, are the most competitive applicants for graduate programs.   toggle   toggle title= Biological Anthropology   Biological Anthropology as a whole represents the more scientific end of anthropology, devoted to the study of biological history, evolutionary relationships, and adaptive diversity that characterizes the human species. Subfields in biological anthropology include (but are not limited to) paleoanthropology, skeletal biology, genetic anthropology, bioarchaeology, primatology, and forensics.   Anatomy, developmental biology, human biology, and paleontology are allied disciplines outside of anthropology. A career in Biological Anthropology necessitates basic knowledge in general biology, chemistry, and genetics.  An understanding of evolutionary biology is essential, and students should seek out courses in evolution as undergraduates. Additionally, biochemistry, cellular biology, organic chemistry and advanced genetics are highly recommended. Students will also find that courses in statistics (quantitative methods) and research design are essential. Advanced experience with independent research in the field and laboratory should be a goal of any undergraduate before applying to graduate programs, both to improve competitiveness of applications and to determine if a professional career in biological anthropology is desired.   toggle   toggle title= Anthropological Archaeology   Anthropological Archaeology is primarily concerned with society and culture in the past, both historical and prehistoric, through the recovery and analysis of material culture and environmental data. Because archaeology can be theoretically and methodologically wide-ranging, the subfield can be variously considered a science and humanity. In addition to undergraduate courses in  anthropological method and theory, students interested in pursuing a career as an archaeologist might consider taking courses in architectural history, biology, chemistry, English, geography, geology, history, museum studies, and mathematics statistics. Proficiency in foreign languages, especially for those working outside of the US or on classical sites, is necessary. Students should also, as undergraduates, get hands-on experience through participation in academic field schools, internships, and or paid positions in the field and in the laboratory, and continue to actively engage in field and laboratory research during their graduate studies. Important to a successful career in all areas of archaeology are strong communication and organizational skills as well as fundamental computers skills in word processing, spreadsheet, and data base use. Aspiring archaeologists will find it necessary to be competent in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) as well.   toggle    accordion  The AAA s eAnthroGuide is a good resource for locating anthropology programs across the country.","link":"http:\/\/anthropology.utk.edu\/so-you-want-to-be-an-anthropologist\/"},{"title":"Application Advice","content":"Application Advice Which Graduate Program is Right for You? Choosing the appropriate graduate program in anthropology takes time and forethought. Prospective graduate applicants should research possible programs carefully, identify faculty within the relevant department or program whose research and expertise fits with their interests, and consider making personal contact with those faculty or scheduling on-campus visits. A primary reason why applicants are denied admission is because they have failed to identify explicitly in their statement of intent how their research interests and goals match well with those of departments, and how specific faculty are equipped to train them in the topics and methods they propose to study. Students should avoid operating on the assumption that because a particular university has a    good reputation    overall that its anthropology program is automatically a good one. Most departments or institutions have particular strengths for which they are known, and students should identify these before applying. Prospective applicants should consider the following when evaluating potential graduate programs  Does the anthropology department offer courses or programs in the areas of your interest? Does the anthropology  department faculty have expertise in your areas of interest? Are those faculty taking on new graduate students? Will you require language  or other highly specialized training? Is such training available at that institution? What Makes a Strong Graduate Application? Applicants to graduate programs in anthropology should familiarize themselves with  the requirements for admission. Some departments indicate basic measures such as desired GRE scores, minimum GPA requirements, or evidence of previous coursework in anthropology. However, applicants are most rigorously evaluated on their statement of intent and the letters of reference submitted on their behalf. Referees should be chosen carefully. It is best to request letters of reference from faculty members from whom you have taken courses in which you have done well, and ideally, whom you have gotten to know outside the classroom. That is, they don   t just know you as a name and a grade. They should have first hand knowledge of your capabilities and can speak to them in a reference letter. Think ahead  if you know you will apply to graduate school in the coming months, make an effort to meet with professors from whom you plan to request letters of reference and talk with them about your plans and allow them to get to know you. Letters of reference from non-academic sources, such as friends or non-academic employers, tend to hold much less weight than academic references. Finally, you should be sure to secure support from your major adviser, especially if you are a Master   s student applying for the Ph.D. A Master   s student who does not include a letter of reference from his or her major adviser raises a red flag. If you intend to prove your ability to shoulder doctoral-level work, it is a good idea to do so by producing an excellent Master   s project and impressing your existing adviser. Be sure to ask your referees to read and comment on your Statement of Intent (see below). Do so well in advance  asking a professor to write a letter or provide feedback on a statement at the very last minute is not likely to positively influence his or her assessment of you. Your    Statement of Intent    A statement of intent  (also known as a    statement of purpose    or a    letter of intent   ) tells the faculty in your desired program what you intend to accomplish as a graduate student, and how you intend to do so. It should demonstrate self-motivation in two ways  First, in what you have accomplished in life so far  have you thought specifically and clearly about your career goals? Have you been taking advantage of undergraduate opportunities that position you well towards achieving those goals? Second, in your vision for the future  do you have a clear idea about  how  you will progress towards your goals as a graduate student in the department to which you are applying? Have you gone so far as to not only identify a faculty member or members who fit well with those goals, but also communicated with them? You should begin that process by sending them your  curriculum vitae  (an academic r  sum  ), communicating your research ideas with them, and opening a discussion with them about how your research interests might also fits with theirs. This should all happen several months before the application deadline. Overall, leave the strong impression that you have researched the department, program, and faculty, and have chosen it carefully. Your statement should not be a narrative about how you   ve always loved anthropology and that going to graduate school would fulfill your life   s dream. This may be true, but instead, think of this application document as your opportunity to convince the faculty to admit  you  over the 200 others who are vying for the same spot. Admission committees are often reviewing hundreds of applications, and 90% of applicants tell us that Anthropology is their dream career     this is why it is important for you to be  specific  about your goals, and to  express them clearly  in written form. While this may be obvious, we cannot not stress this final point enough  write clearly, spell correctly, use good grammar, and be sure to proof read your letter.      After all, if you are not willing to do this in your letter of intent, why would  faculty think you would do so in a paper, thesis, or dissertation? Instructions for Applying to Graduate Studies in Anthropology Items to be submitted to the Graduate School Letter of Intent Writing Sample such as an academic paper, a summary of a research project, or a short chapter of a thesis. This should be no more than 15 pages and should relate to your area of research. Three letters of recommendation Official copy of transcript(s) GRE scores TOEFL scores (if applicable) * There is a place on the Graduate School   s application website to list referees and to notify them by email requesting them to submit their letters. The deadline for applications for admission for Fall 2016 is midnight, December 1, 2016. This deadline may differ from deadlines posted by the Graduate School for international students, which is February 1. Please be sure to have all of your application materials submitted in the online application at the Graduate School website by the deadline set by Anthropology to be sure that your application is considered. Please note that students cannot apply for mid-year admission. Applications for graduate assistantships are considered separately from the graduate application. If you wish to be considered for funding by the Anthropology Department, submit an application online. Applications are due on February 1. You can submit an application for funding prior to confirmation of acceptance into the program  if you are not accepted, your application will be removed from the pool.

Follow Graduate School guidelines in assembling your application materials. Please note that while the Graduate School website does not indicate that GRE   s, Letters of Intent or Writing Samples are required, if you are applying for graduate work in Anthropology, you must submit them.","link":"http:\/\/anthropology.utk.edu\/application-advice\/"},{"title":"Mission","content":"Mission The mission of the Department of Anthropology is to achieve excellence in undergraduate and graduate instruction, research and scholarship, institutional service, and community or public outreach. The Department s mission is pursued by developing, maintaining, and promoting balance and interdependence across the subdisciplines of archaeology, biological anthropology, and cultural anthropology. The Department is therefore committed to successfully design, implement, and monitor undergraduate and graduate curricula that reflect the many different interests of anthropologists, but which emphasize that the greatest strength of the discipline is its core concepts uniting anthropological inquiry. The Department s commitment to academia, the public, and its students is firmly grounded in quality and ethically-responsible research and scholarship and that the Department encourages to the greatest possible extent innovative and collaborative research and teaching that focus the activities of faculty from different subdisciplines on common goals. The Department further recognizes its responsibility to promote greater understanding of human diversity in the university and public communities. In keeping with these goals, the Department is committed to intellectual freedom, equal opportunity, and affirmative action for its faculty, staff, and students. The Department acknowledges the importance of cultural diversity as a theme in both current public debates and disciplinary discourse. The Department further recognizes its role and responsibility to promote greater understanding of racial and cultural diversity among its faculty, students, and the university and public communities. The Department of Anthropology strives to enhance cultural diversity within the discipline by encouraging and recruiting students from historically underrepresented ethnic, national, and class groups to study Anthropology and to bring their perspective and concerns to it. In keeping with these goals, the Department is committed to equal opportunity and affirmative action for its faculty, staff, and students regardless of race, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, or area of teaching and research focus.","link":"http:\/\/anthropology.utk.edu\/mission\/"},{"title":"Newsletter","content":"Newsletter Select the edition below to view the Department of Anthropology Newsletter. 2013 2011 ","link":"http:\/\/anthropology.utk.edu\/newsletter\/"},{"title":"Topper Site Archaeological Project","content":"Topper Site Archaeological Project  caption id= attachment_804  align= alignright  width= 300   Woodland Block East at the Topper Site (38AL23), highlighting the Late Precontact occupation features.  caption  The Topper site is one of the most remarkable Paleoindian sites ever found in the Southeastern United States, with well-preserved remains dating from the present back to upwards of 13,000 calendar years before the present. The Clovis remains from the site, from a culture dating from ca. 13,250 to 12,850 cal yr BP, are among the densest ever found in North America. Likewise, a remarkable Late Woodland occupation has been found at the site, roughly dating from ca. AD 800 to 1400. Field schools run by the University of Tennessee, Knoxville Department of Anthropology in the summers of 2015 and 2016, as well as the ongoing laboratory work are focused on excavating and analyzing these Late Prehistoric materials. If you would like to contribute to this project and check out our current progress, please check out our 2016 Newsletter! Topper Site Field School The Topper Site Field School is an official University of Tennessee, Knoxville field school. Enrolled students successfully completing the field school will receive 3 semester credit hours under ANTH 430 or ANTH 530, Fieldwork in Archaeology. The fieldwork will be directed towards the prehistoric archaeological sites at the Topper in Allendale County, South Carolina. Students will receive training in a wide range of archaeological field survey, excavation, and analysis procedures over the course of the three week field program. The project will be based at the Archroma company property in Martin, South Carolina. Archroma is graciously making their public campground available to project participants, as well as a large pavilion called the picnic shelter for use as a laboratory and for lectures and public talks, which are expected to occur most afternoons and early evening each day the field work is underway. Accordingly, we agree to follow their rules and regulations. Additional information about the Topper Site, and the research that has been conducted there in years past, can be found at   http   www.southeasternpaleoamerican.org  The field school will be directed by Dr. David G. Anderson, assisted by a number of graduate students and professional archaeologists from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and other institutions of higher education. It will be directed to the complementary goals of student training, public education, and basic research. Should you have additional questions about the project, contact David G. Anderson at dander19@utk.edu. https   vimeo.com 194864609 Independent Study in Archaeological Lab Methods The goal of this independent study course is  to introduce students to archaeological laboratory methods and techniques through hands-on experience. Students work with the materials excavated at the Topper Site (38AL23) by UTK students during the summers field school. Students are  introduced to and engage in artifact cleaning, cataloging, and photography  precontact ceramic and lithic analyses  basic introduction to geographic information systems (GIS) and database management  and the preparation of national and regional conference posters and presentation. Instructor permission is required for course registration. For more information or to register please contact Dr. David Anderson (dander19@utk.edu). Students may register for from 1 to 3 credits per semester.

What are the minimum scores on the GRE to be considered for admission? The Anthropology Department does not set minimum scores for the GRE. Most admitted applicants score at or within the 90th percentile. In Biological Anthropology, quantitative scores are especially important.   However, we recognize that standardized tests are not always the best measure of aptitude, so we evaluate the whole application. 2. Is there a minimum GPA requirement? Yes, applicants must have a minimum overall GPA of 3.30. 3. What parts of the application are most important? We evaluate applications to the graduate program in their entirety. We look for a clear statement of intent, GPA of 3.30 or above, strong letters of reference, and solid GRE scores. No single piece is considered the most important. Please visit our website, and especially our advice for prospective applicants, to see what makes a strong application packet. 4. I did not complete an undergraduate degree in Anthropology. Can I still be considered for the graduate program? Applicants with a major in a related field (such as biology, sociology, geology, classics, history, historic preservation, or geography) will be considered only if they have a formal minor in Anthropology or its equivalent (at least five upper-division Anthropology courses). Students applying to the MA program with a focus in Archaeology should demonstrate familiarity with lab and field work, either through completion of a field school or employment in the field. Students applying to the PhD program MUST have prior field and lab experience. 5. I did not complete my Bachelor   s nor my Master   s in Anthropology, but I would like to apply to the PhD program. Can I still be considered for admission? A BA or MA degree in Anthropology or a minor in Anthropology and a degree in a related field is required for admission to the PhD program. Applicants with a major in a related field (such as biology, sociology, geology, classics, history, historic preservation, or geography) will be considered only if they have a formal minor in Anthropology or its equivalent (at least five upper-division Anthropology courses). Only students with GPAs above a 3.30 overall in undergraduate or graduate work will be considered for admission. 6. I completed my undergraduate degree in Anthropology at UTK and I would like to be admitted into the graduate program. What are my chances? Students who completed undergraduate degrees in Anthropology at UTK must compete with all other applicants on an even field. Occasionally we accept students who completed their BA   s with us into the graduate program. Students who are well known to the department may actually find themselves at a disadvantage if they have not performed exceptionally well at the undergraduate level. The department also encourages diversification of training. If you want a PhD from UTK and you completed your BA with us, you might consider pursuing a Master   s degree elsewhere first, and then reapplying. 7. What are my chances of being accepted into the graduate program? We do not have a set admission rate. Admission depends on many variables  the strength of your application relative to all other applications we receive  whether an appropriate faculty member is available and willing to advise new students  availability of funding  the fit between your interests and our program  and the total number of applications we receive in a given sub-discipline, etc. Our program in Biological Anthropology and especially Forensic Anthropology receives over one hundred applications every year, so obviously the admission rate in that program is low relative to number of applications received. 8. I would like to focus on two or more sub-disciplines of Anthropology at once, for example, Forensic and Cultural Anthropology, or Biological Anthropology and Archaeology. But the application requires me to indicate one sub-discipline. What should I do? You are free to indicate more than one sub-discipline on your application. Faculty in the indicated sub-disciplines will review your application jointly and come to a collective decision about admission.   Your letter of intent should explain how your research interests are at the interface of two or more sub-disciplines. Anthropology is a holistic discipline and we welcome students who wish to focus on more than one sub-discipline. 9. I am interested in pursuing the Disasters, Displacement, and Human Rights (DDHR) program. Is there anything additional I have to do to apply for that? If you are interested in participating in the DDHR program, please indicate that in your letter of intent and explain how the program fits your particular interests and goals. You might also consider contacting the DDHR faculty at ddhr@utk.edu. There is an additional application for students planning to complete the Graduate Certificate in DDHR available on the departmental website  however, this is not required for admission and there is no specific deadline. The DDHR application process is only to track those students participating in the program and can be completed after you have matriculated. 10. How can I find out about faculty research expertise? Click here to view faculty profiles and CVs. Many faculty include links to their published work on their profile page.   If you would like to study with a particular faculty member, we recommend sending them an email to introduce yourself.   We expect prospective students to make the effort to learn about faculty research expertise through the available information.   11. What is the average length of time it takes to complete a graduate degree in Anthropology? It depends on several factors, including your existing preparation in Anthropology  your ability to identify and pursue a sustained research focus  the number and type of other responsibilities you have that require your time and attention  and the resources available to you. It also varies by type of research. If your project entails working with an existing data set and you do not need to travel for long periods, you may finish more rapidly. Projects that require long periods of fieldwork and or language mastery may take considerably longer. In general, though, we like to see students complete a Master   s degree within three years of matriculation, and a PhD within five years of matriculation.    12. If I receive funding through the department, does it automatically renew, and for how long will I have it? New and returning students who wish to be considered for funding in the form of teaching assistantships must apply (or re-apply) every year. Pending availability, funding is typically renewed for students who perform adequately in their assistantship duties and show evidence of progress in their graduate program. If you are selected for an assistantship at the Master   s level, you may be funded for a maximum of 3 years, and at the PhD level, for a maximum of 5 years.   It is not guaranteed you will maintain funding for this entire period, however. Students should view funding as an investment the department and university makes in their successful training and career development. It should not be viewed as either a    job    or an entitlement. The goal is for funded students to successfully complete the program in a timely fashion.    13. Can or should I send application materials in hard copy and or as email attachments? No. Our application procedure has moved to an entirely electronic, centralized submission system called ADMIT. All application materials should be submitted through the Graduate School website and ADMIT system. This includes documents like letters of reference, which your referees should upload themselves, and supplementary materials like your letter of intent, transcript, and writing sample, which you will upload yourself. (NOTE  these are REQUIRED by the Anthropology department). Hard copies of documents or additional email attachments may become lost in the shuffle and often require us to scan and upload them manually. We strongly encourage applicants NOT to send materials by hard copy or email attachment. If exceptional circumstances demand that you send hard copies or email attachments, contact us at UTAnthGradAdmissions@utk.edu. 14. What should I submit as a writing sample? Writing samples of less than 20 pages (preferably 10 pages or less) must be uploaded through the centralized ADMIT system. If you wish to include a link to your thesis, you may do so in your letter of intent. Please do not try to upload your entire thesis.   15. What are the deadlines for applying to the graduate program in Anthropology? The deadline set by the Department of Anthropology is December 1. Please note that this is EARLIER than the deadline listed on the Graduate School website where you will submit your application materials. The Department   s deadlines trump the Graduate School   s.     For international students, there may be additional deadlines and application requirements set by the Graduate School. It is the applicant   s responsibility to understand and meet all necessary deadlines and requirements. 16. I would like to be considered for a teaching assistantship, but I do not see where I can indicate that on my application. Applications for funding from the department are separate from the application for admission, and the deadline is February 1.   If you are a new applicant, therefore, you must submit all application materials for admission by December 1, but return to the website and submit a funding application by February 1 to be considered. Click here to  complete the application for an assistantship.   Teaching assistantships within the department are limited. Applicants are encouraged to visit the Graduate School website for information about other funding opportunities at UT. 17. What if I miss a deadline? Or what if my letters of reference are late? If you miss the December 1 deadline for the application altogether, we may not be able to consider you for admission that cycle. However, depending on the circumstances, exceptions can be made, so please contact the Director of Graduate Admissions, at UTAnthGradAdmissions@utk.edu. After we begin processing applications, you will be notified if we have not received a required piece of documentation. We typically get a large number of applicants within a day or two or on the day of the deadline. These applicants should not expect notification of missing documents  it is often after the deadline before we have time to check to see if everything has arrived. If your application is missing a document, you will have an opportunity to rectify the situation. However, keep in mind that we receive a high volume of applications and it is your responsibility to be sure all pieces of your application arrive in time. We cannot guarantee admission consideration if your application, or any part of it, is incomplete or late.

This class is organized around a series of lectures by distinguished scholars which will help us better understand crises as well as aid us in developing solutions to ameliorate the causes and conditions surrounding crises of various kinds. Moreover, these lectures will clearly demonstrate that cultural anthropology, archaeology and physical anthropology as well, of course, as anthropology in general, can help us achieve these goals. Crises are axial events because, as Eric Wolf (1990) has argued,    the arrangement of societies are most visible when they are challenged by crisis.    Crises, also offer the social scientist a fine opportunity to study the social and cultural construction of reality. Crises are ubiquitous through time and space and found in many different forms. Some examples of crises, among others, include  Mass Emergencies Disasters (both natural and unnatural) Displacement due to development, disasters, economic dislocation, etc. Social Conflict War Genocide Environmental Justice Globalization Immigration Epidemics Environmental disruption Coordinator  Gregory V.

We are fortunate to have this speaker   s series as there are few like it in the entire nation. Without a doubt, this is an extraordinary opportunity for you to become more familiar with current research in contemporary anthropology. A primary objective is to provide students and faculty the chance to meet leading scholars in anthropology and related disciplines to learn more about their previous and continuing research. Another major objective of this class is to provide students with an overview of the diversity of research subsumed under anthropology and related disciplines. Selected faculty and graduate students from UT will talk about their research, to give you an idea what being an anthropologist is all about and hopefully inspire you to make your own unique contributions to the discipline.

Cabana This series explores how    identity    is constructed through understandings of heritage and ancestry.    Identity,    as it is commonly used today, has a dual, linked sense, as both social and personal identity. As a social category, identity is defined by membership rules and (alleged) characteristic attributes or expected behaviors. Personal identity is some distinguishing characteristic (or characteristics) that a person takes a special pride in or views as socially consequential but more-or-less unchangeable. A key part of identity is heritage and ancestry. Though we typically think of these two concepts as given, or fixed, parts of who we are, we are actually constantly engaged in    heritage-making.      That is, we adopt and mobilize conceptualizations of heritage, including ethnicity, gender status, class, and even    race,    in personal and social identity formation. Beyond individual identity, heritage is also about regional or national identities (or religious identities) and the construction maintenance remembering of narratives revolving around individuals or events that are seen as foundational or embodying group values. The broad purpose of this speaker series is to showcase anthropological approaches to identity, heritage, and ancestry. How have anthropologists incorporated identity studies into their work, and how have they explored the relationships between identity, heritage, and ancestry? While cultural anthropologists (and sociologists) have been addressing identity issues for decades, archaeologists (including bioarchaeologists) have only relatively recently done so. In contrast, biological anthropologists only occasionally touch on the topic directly. Interestingly, it may be from biological anthropology     particularly in the field of genetics     that some of the most controversial work relating to identity has sprung, to the point that some have accused Anthropological Geneticists of bringing    race    back to the table. Therefore, a main question explored in this series is  how have any of these conceptualizations (of identity heritage ancestry) derived from scientific domains, and to what extent would this matter? In sum, the speaker series aims to  Explore the importance of heritage and ancestry in identity formation. Understand how science, in all its manifestations and applications, shape both the present and past social world in terms of identity and identity formation. Anthropology is an ideal discipline through which to explore this question, since anthropological practitioners have been engaged in all facets of identity politics as producers, consumers, observers, and critics. Because this topic crosscuts other scholarly disciplines, however, the series will also welcome and include speakers outside of Anthropology. 1 Fearon (1999)     What is Identity (As We Now Use the Word)?    http   www.stanford.edu  jfearon Participate in the VoiceThread forums.

Yet, since the founding of the discipline, anthropologists in every sub-field have applied their knowledge in ways that directly impact populations and issues under study and engage matters of broad public concern. Whether interfacing with policymakers, testifying in legal matters, participating in criminal investigations, engaging in international development, preserving and portraying the past, or working with the media, medical institutions, businesses and government entities (including the military), anthropologists have contributed expertise and raised important questions about issues that matter. Within universities and research institutions, out in the field, or working in the public and private sectors, anthropology continues to define and redefine its relevance to the    real world,    a project it often shares with other humanistic, social, and natural sciences. This goal is sometimes in contrast to the popular images of anthropology as either virtuosic adventure or tedious laboratory analysis. So what exactly does anthropology contribute to the public sphere and to public understanding? The 38th  annual Visiting Lecture Series addresses the diverse ways that anthropologists and others have worked in and with    the public sphere    and the key debates that accompany such efforts. Over the past two decades, the term    public anthropology    has emerged to capture the theoretical, methodological, and practical dimensions of the discipline simultaneously  more recently, this term has been featured centrally by academic presses and publishing series, in flagship journals, and in debates about the long-range plan and overall mission of the American Anthropological Association. More generally but no less importantly, the role of anthropology in the public sphere is of concern to current graduate students, who face a narrow, highly competitive job market in academia and therefore demonstrate expanding interest in meaningful and practical applications of their knowledge, skills, and research outside the university setting. Topics of specific interest to this series include  Cultural Resource Management  historic preservation and museum studies  biocultural and bioarchaeological analyses  forensic investigations of domestic and international crimes  disaster risk reduction, recovery and identification  human rights investigations  legal testimony and interventions  policy-oriented research and interventions  critically-engaged activist research  collaborative and community-based participatory research     embedded    anthropology (with the media and or military)  critical medical anthropology  environmental research  critical humanitarian studies  and anthropologists    work with the private sector and non-governmental organizations Schedule Week 1    Aug 17 (W) UC Auditorium (10 10 am) Introduction to the Course, no speakers Anth 550 ANTH 550    Aug 18 (Th) MM 63 (3 40 pm) Introduction to the Course, no speakers Anth 357 450 ANTH 357 450 Week 2    Aug 23 (Tu) MM 63 (3 40 pm) Hugh Gusterson, Cultural Anthropology, George Mason University, Illicit Drinking Among Teenagers ANTH 357 450    Aug 24 (W) UC Auditorium (10 10 am) Hugh Gusterson, Cultural Anthropology, George Mason University The Human Terrain Systems Project ANTH 550    Aug 25 (Th) MM 63 (3 40 pm) Karla McKanders     UT College of Law - Representing Immigrants and Asylees in Tennessee ANTH 357 450 Week 3    Aug 30 (Tu) MM 63 (3 40 pm) Boyce Driskell - Archaeology Research Lab, UT The practice of archaeology in cultural resource management at UT ANTH 357 450    Sep 1 (Th) MM 63 (3 40 pm) Sarah Walters     MA Candidate, Archaeology, UT    The Public Really Digs It!

Two courses have been built around the visitors, one undergraduate and one graduate, with lectures presented in each one.   This year is no exception, and this course is the graduate section of the visiting lecture series. This semester, the focus of the course is on Anthropology and Religion.   Speakers from various sub-disciplines of Anthropology whose research focusses on the human religious experience are included. In addition to the visiting lectures, this course will also be used to provide more intensive orientation to graduate students by exposing them to the entire Anthropology faculty and the research being carried out in the Department.     This will be done over the first few weeks of the semester, when nearly all faculty and research staff in Anthropology and its units will visit and address the course.

This year the theme is    Ethics in Anthropology.    General topics will include ethical issues in all four major themes of anthropology     linguistics, cultural anthropology, biological anthropology and archaeology. While by no means comprehensive, the speakers in the course will cover topics of broad interest for pre-professionals in anthropology, including bioethics, the ethics of working with children and animals, and reporting of ethical violations. The speakers will discuss ethical concerns that arise both in the general workplace (e.g. university setting, CRM firm) as well as in various field settings.

DDHR faculty and students study global and local issues in the past and present, including migration, displacement, trafficking slavery, and refugees and asylum seekers  structural and political violence and dynamics of peace and justice  economic development, inequality, resource access extraction, and food security  post-conflict investigations and transitional justice  identity and discrimination  and the causes and consequences of wars, (un)natural disasters, and climate change. We foster critical and nuanced perspectives on the substantive concepts of human rights and the international legal norms and institutions that embody and enact them. Through innovative, inter-subdisciplinary work in cultural, biological forensic and archaeological anthropology we contribute to the development of anthropology as a science, as an art, and as a tool for improving the human condition. Beginning with the fall 2013 catalogue, UT Anthropology offers a graduate certificate and undergraduate concentration in DDHR. Required courses include the Anthropology of Human Rights, Forensic Science and Human Rights, and Disasters. A range of subdisciplinary electives allows students to specialize while fostering holistic training. Access to the department   s first-rate resources, such as the Forensic Anthropology Center and the Anthropological Genetics Lab, archaeological field schools, and research and study abroad in northern Uganda and elsewhere, provide students with opportunities to develop knowledge and skills in-context.

What do I have to do? A  You must be a declared Anthropology major to participate in the DDHR concentration at the undergraduate level. After declaring your major, you must fill out a DDHR Application and send it to ddhr@utk.edu. We will then make the necessary changes to your profile in Banner. Q  Why do I have to fill out a DDHR application? A  The application is essential because we have to change your profile in Banner. If you do not submit an application, we do not know you are participating in DDHR, and the concentration will not show up on your transcript, even if you have completed all the courses. Q  What if my application to DDHR is rejected? A  The application is not for the purposes of accepting or rejecting students. It is required so that we know you are participating and can change your profile in Banner. It also helps us to stay in touch with our students and know about their areas of interest, which helps us with course planning, etc. Q  Do I have to do anything extra to complete the DDHR concentration? A  The DDHR concentration can be completely satisfied within the Anthropology major requirements. You do not have to do anything extra besides fill out the application. Q  I am getting close to graduating and I didn   t know about the DDHR concentration until recently. Can I still do the concentration in Anthropology? A  Yes, if the following criteria are fulfilled  You must be a declared Anthropology major. You must elect to graduate under the fall 2013 catalog (the semester year the DDHR program started). You must submit the DDHR application. You must have taken the three DDHR core courses (ANTH 419, ANTH 420, ANTH 489) plus one more elective. You must have earned at least a 3.0 in DDHR courses. Q  I am not an Anthropology major but I want to do the DDHR concentration. A  Non-majors are welcome to take DDHR-related courses. However, completing the formal concentration requires that you are a declared Anthropology major. Q  How do I find out what DDHR courses are being offered? A  Check the DDHR website. Updated information about courses offered each semester is posted there. Q  I am a graduate student in Anthropology and would like to pursue the DDHR Certificate. How do I do that? A  To obtain the DDHR Certificate you must fill out an DDHR Application to the DDHR program in Anthropology. You must complete all the required courses and earn at least a 3.0 in each one. When you apply for graduation, the Graduate School will also require an application for the Certificate and will check that you meet all the criteria. Q  I am a graduate student in anther department. Can I complete the DDHR certificate? A  Yes, the DDHR certificate is available to graduate students in any College or Department at UTK and non-degree seeking students who have been accepted by the Graduate School. You must fill out the DDHR application, however, so that we know you are participating. Q  What does the graduate certificate prepare me to do? Am I certified in some way? A  The graduate certificate demonstrates that you have pursued a particular training focus in Anthropology. It does not certify you as a practitioner. Q  I have taken classes in other departments that are very relevant to the DDHR program. Can these count for DDHR credit in Anthropology? A  It is possible that courses taken outside of Anthropology can count for the DDHR concentration or graduate certificate. Contact ddhr@utk.edu for information about how to petition these courses for DDHR credit. Q  I submitted an application to the DDHR program but I did not receive a letter of acceptance. A  We do not issue letters of acceptance, however we do try to send an acknowledgment of receipt. If you submitted an application for the undergraduate concentration, check your major in Banner or your DARS report to confirm that your profile has changed in Banner.

The program graduates inter-disciplinarily trained researchers and practitioners who address natural and anthropogenic disasters, conflict and violence, historical and contemporary processes of displacement, and development. The 2015 DDHR Conference,    Bridging the Collaborative Gap,    will explore and problematize the practice of collaboration at all levels. International researchers and practitioners who exemplify collaboration and or cross-training within and or outside of anthropology are particularly invited to participate.  Moreover, since research and praxis within DDHR necessarily entails engagement of affected populations, we seek the participation of members of affected communities, especially those who have worked closely with anthropologists and other professionals. Undergraduate and graduate students are encouraged to participate in all aspects of the conference.

Lessons learned from the study of the initial colonization of other parts of the world will also be briefly explored, as will theories and approaches to the study of human migration.  Issues  examined include when people arrived (i.e., the Clovis vs. Pre   Clovis debate)  the impact human populations may have had upon landscape and biota (the Pleistocene extinction debate)  entry and migration routes  and how people settled into the landscape once they arrived (the early new World archaeological record, to ca. 10,000 BP). The course will also examine legal and political issues related to the initial peopling of the Americas, from both anthropological and Native American perspectives. 522 660 Seminar in Archaeology (3)  Hunter-Gatherer Archaeology and Ethnography The course  examines the current literature and thinking about hunter-gatherers worldwide.

Paleoanthropology, human osteology, and human variation and population structure. 690 Readings in Biological Evolution In this seminar, we will explore some of the key primary literature in biological evolution. Some previous knowledge of key evolutionary concepts is a must. The theoretical foundation of biological anthropology is evolutionary theory.   As anthropologists in the 21st century, most of our understanding of evolution derives from secondary sources  professors, textbooks, and academic literature. While these sources provide valuable interpretations, what additional understanding can we gain by reading primary sources? What is evolutionary theory? Is there more than one? Why does it form the basis of our subfield? Are we applying evolutionary theory ies fruitfully? Have we lost sight of some of the most interesting theoretical questions in our common bioanthropological pursuits? 690 Migration and Morphometrics This seminar explores the background, methods, and application of techniques for the reconstruction of morphology from archaeological human skeletal remains. This is discussed in the context of human adaptation to environmental factors, migration, and population history in the Americas. The majority of the seminar discussion is devoted to the methods for and utilization of estimating human morphology from skeletal remains. For example, how does one evaluate the various methods that are available for the estimation of stature from skeletons? Which should be used, and what problems might you anticipate from applying your choice? These estimated dimensions are related to evolutionary models and skeletal biology hypotheses that associate morphological variation with environmental effects, namely those associated with climate, subsistence, and activity. Students are asked to compare the merits of different sources of information that can be gleaned from the skeleton and from their archaeological contexts throughout the course. 695 Gross Human Anatomy (9) Skeleton, muscles, and cardiovascular system.

As a cultural anthropologist interested in politics, law,  and human rights,  she is  studying  how  Eritreans in  Africa, North America, and Europe navigate  paths to asylum and resettlement in the global North. She is interested in how national asylum policies and practices in places like the US and  the European Union  interact with the patterns of forced migration from the Horn of Africa, and the dynamics of the long-established  Eritrean  diaspora.  Using multi-sited ethnographic methods and  anthropological approaches to forced migration, transnationalism, and human rights,  she is  focusing on a comparison of asylum seekers  who have  been successful in  obtaining refugee status in Germany and the United States, and whether their experiences of repression, flight, and refugee  determination procedures  are important in shaping an emergent human rights activism  that is observable in the global Eritrean diaspora today. Having studied the political and cultural dynamics of the Eritrean diaspora for more than a decade,  her current  research follows  the new generation of Eritrean forced migrants who have fled problems of political repression, militarism,  and human rights violations. As these new refugees leave Eritrea, they  must navigate complex and often extremely harsh conditions in their quest for lasting safety and security. This includes detention and possible deportation from multiple countries, including the US and EU. Even when Eritreans reach a safe country, they  enter a global diaspora which continues to grow and change in relationship to events in the Horn of Africa. This diaspora is also an important component of transnational governance for the  regime  that Eritreans are fleeing, meaning that refugees and asylum seekers are never completely safe from the repression they left behind. At the same time, a change in the principles governing diaspora activism is clearly marked. Today, Eritreans are engaged in human rights discourse and rights-based approaches to political change for the first time in their history. This growth of human rights discourse and organizing is occurring at the same time that countries which long supported refugees and asylum seekers, like Germany and the US, have come to see the latter as unwanted potential security risks. How do Eritreans come to see themselves as possessing inalienable rights amid so many forces that threaten these? How have new refugees and asylum seekers  changed the dynamics of diaspora political organization today? What role do the frameworks of asylum and refugee policy and law in places like the EU and US play in shaping  emerging human rights  consciousness? Are there discernible differences between Eritreans who go to Germany and those who go to the US, and if so, why?  How do asylum seekers and refugees exercise agency and choice  amidst so many constraining factors? In future research,  she hopes to address the key differences between urban refugees and those who have lived in refugee camps administered by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  This will build on research conducted in Ethiopia in summer 2008  by Lily Harmon-Gross, a former graduate student in cultural anthropology (M.A. University of Tennessee, 2009) under  her guidance.

Auerbach The ancestral populations, antiquity of human movements, the patterns of colonization in the Americas continue to be topics of great interest to all sub-disciplines of anthropology.   His ongoing research program pursues these topics by examining human morphological variation in the New World prior to European colonization half a millennium ago.   Most of this work uses the skeletal remains from past populations to reconstruct the shape, size, proportions, and strength of bodies.   These are in turn examined to document patterns of morphological variation across the Americas and change in physical appearance over time.   The goal of this research is to discern the movements and possible adaptations of humans as they encountered novel environments and settled over long periods in the diverse ecologies of North and South America. This research was initially funded by the National Science Foundation, resulting in a data set of measurements obtained by  him from the skeletal remains of over 3000 adult humans from 180 archaeological sites.   These include some of the oldest human remains recovered in North America, including the Kennewick, Spirit Cave, Horn Shelter, Wizard   s Beach, and Little Salt Spring skeletons.   The data set continues to form the basis of future investigations, which will seek an expanded sample from the Americas and gather additional types of metric and non-metric data.   Students interested in investigating modern human variation and adaptation in the Americas are encouraged to join in this expanding research agenda. Related to this research, a Center for Archaeological Investigations (CAI) Visiting Scholar conference organized by  him was held at Southern Illinois University Carbondale in April 2008 to bring together archaeologists and biological anthropologists.

Historical archaeologists study the emergence of the modern world from an anthropological perspective, with a special emphasis on material culture. The focus cultivates important links with faculty and students in other departments and research units of the University, including Geography and History, the Archaeology Research Laboratory, and the McClung Museum. This research focus provides faculty and students with a collaborative setting for scholarly research, cultural resource management, and public outreach. Research addressing theoretical concerns centers on the global expansion of capitalism and variability in social complexity and systems of inequality that emerged in frontier encounters and solidified in colonial and post-colonial settings.   Methodologically, historical archaeologists and affiliated scholars are developing innovative approaches in faunal and botanical analyses, geophysics, geomorphology, and dendrochronology to address these issues. Research is supported through the Charles Faulkner Archaeology Laboratory, curating a significant comparative collection of historic ceramics, glass, architectural fragments and other artifacts dating primarily from the late eighteenth- through early twentieth centuries, and the Faunal Laboratory, housing more than 10,000 specimens used for comparative analysis in studies of historic subsistence. Other important facilities include the Archaeology Research Laboratory, which houses the Archaeobotanical Laboratory and maintains a suite of geophysical equipment for site survey and assessment, the Laboratory of Tree Ring Science housed in the Department of Geography, and the GIS resources in Hodges Library   s Map Services. Faculty experience in historical archaeology is wide ranging in geographical scope, methodology, and time depth. David Anderson has conducted remote sensing, controlled surface collection, and excavation on a range of historic period sites, including Civil War battlefields, tenant farmsteads, and plantation slave village complexes throughout the Southeast and Caribbean. Barbara Heath has worked on urban and rural sites in the Middle Atlantic and Caribbean dating from the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries. Much of her research addresses the development and maturation of racialized slavery during and immediately following the era of the transatlantic slave trade as materialized in landscapes, architecture, and portable consumer goods.  She teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in historical archaeology, historic material culture, the archaeology of the African diaspora, the archaeology of the historic Chesapeake and Upland South, and current trends in historical archaeology. Heath and Schroedl are collaborating with and international team of scholars as well as scientists at the Missouri Research Reactor to conduct instrumental neutron activation analysis of historic West Indian pottery. The project is part of a larger effort to reconstruct the networks of production, distribution, and consumption of these wares by enslaved Africans and their descendants. Gerald Schroedl has worked extensively on historic Cherokee sites in East Tennessee, and at Brimstone Hill Fortress, a World Heritage site located on St. Kitts in the Caribbean. His work examines the material correlates of military hierarchy and social inequality as expressed in the architecture of the fort and the material culture of its residents.  He teaches courses in anthropological theory, cultural resource management, and Southeastern Indians. Walter Klippel   s research focuses on historic subsistence practices, with a particular emphasis on marine resources, taphonomy, and historic systems of provisioning. His recent work includes the analysis of military food supply systems and diet at Brimstone Hill and the analysis of provisioned and non-provisioned foods at Poplar Forest, an antebellum plantation in Central Virginia.  He teaches courses in principles of zooarchaeology and laboratory studies in zooarchaeology. Research and teaching interests of affiliated faculty include the cultural landscapes of plantation slavery (Kandace Hollenbach, Elizabeth Kellar DeCorse, and Lydia Pulsipher), the historical archaeology of East Tennessee (Charles Faulkner and Elizabeth Kellar DeCorse), and the use of dendrochronology as an archaeological dating tool (Henri Grissino-Mayer). Undergraduate and graduate students whose primary expertise is in biological anthropology and cultural anthropology also find the concerns of historical archaeology relevant to their interests. For example, a recent undergraduate honors thesis has combined historical archaeology with an epidemiological study of early-twentieth-century East Tennessee, while another has combined forensic evidence with the archaeology of massacre to better understand sites of organized violence in American history. Graduate work in cultural anthropology draws on the method and theory of historical archaeology in work relating to human rights, forced migration, conflict, and disaster. Examples of current graduate student research include Master   s theses and Doctoral dissertations investigating a nineteenth-century leprosarium on St. Thomas, USVI    the role of the Anglican church in settling the seventeenth-century frontier in the Lowcountry of South Carolina  developing an archaeological approach to studying creolization among enslaved Virginians  and exploring the changing cultural landscape of an upland South farmstead.

St. Kitts is a former British colony that attained independence in 1983. The capital is Basseterre and the island population is ca.  40,000. St. Kitts has a tropical climate with daytime temperatures of 85 to 90  F and night time lows of 75-80  F. Tropical showers are common, but they rarely last more than 20 minutes. Brimstone Hill is a British fortress dating 1690 to 1853. Sometimes called the Gibraltar of the West Indies, it is among the largest and best preserved colonial military complexes in the New World. The fortress is perched atop Brimstone Hill, a volcanic intrusion rising to over 700 ft above sea level. The fortress covers 40 acres and includes over 50 distinctive structures and buildings. The fort was constructed and maintained by enslaved Africans. Archaeological studies at Brimstone Hill are intended to  Discover and document the role African slaves played in the fort s construction and maintenance. Provide accurate information about the architecture of individual structures used or occupied by slaves so that they can be properly restored for visitation by the public. Demonstrate that the heritage of Brimstone Hill is as much African-Caribbean as it is Colonial British. Provide the people of St. Kitts an historical context from which to understand and appreciate their own culture. In cooperation with the Brimstone Hill Fortress National Park Society, the University of Tennessee conducted work at the site from 1996-1999 and 2004-2008. There are currently no plans to conduct excavations at the site in 2009.

The site is located on a tributary to the Potomac River on Virginia   s Northern Neck. The project explores the landscape of an early British colonial plantation through documenting and interpreting cultural and environmental changes, and studying them in the context of broader changes in the region and the wider Atlantic world. Recent scholarship has advocated using a fine-grained approach to questions of economic, demographic, and socio-political colonial development in the Chesapeake focusing on river valleys as analytical units. The Northern Neck is underrepresented archaeologically, with most work relating to the 17th century focusing on the James and York River drainages. Site and Project History John Mottrom, one of the earliest English settlers of the Potomac   s south bank, established a household there sometime before 1644. The property quickly became the center of the Chicacoan community who took their name from the principal village of an important Indian chiefdom. Some of the English Chicacoans participated in the uprising known as Ingle   s Rebellion, which resulted in the overthrow of Cecil Calvert   s Maryland government in the mid-1640s. Mottrom helped arm the rebel faction. He was elected to the House of Burgesses, and his property became the legislative seat for Northumberland County, the first English county on the Northern Neck. Mottrom was among the earliest planters in the Potomac Valley to use enslaved African labor. Elizabeth Key, a woman whom he attempted to enslave, contested her status in court and won her freedom following his death in 1655. Subsequently his son and grandson developed the property, expanded the labor force, and navigated the troubled political, racial, and economic currents of the second half of the 17th century. Excavations from 2011 to 2016 exposed portions of the 20 ft. x 54 ft. manor house. It is likely the original circa 1640 dwelling, but this cannot be confirmed without excavating associated features. The house consists of two equal-sized rooms on either side of an H-shaped chimney. The house was originally earthfast (built with posts set directly into the ground), repaired with new posts, and later underpinned with brick. West of the hearth, GPR results revealed a large, deep cellar. In 2015, field school participants began to remove its fill. The cellar cuts through an earlier historic feature at the site whose purpose is as yet unknown. The archaeological and geophysical results hint at a complex landscape that developed across the six acres that surround the house. Features north and east of the dwelling have been discovered archaeologically that are likely associated with a service buildings, including a possible kitchen. Evidence of fence lines or palisades were also found during the geophysical survey of the site. In 2017, excavations will be carried out to better understand the evolution of the structures and associated landscapes. Questions that the project will explicitly address in 2017 are anthropological, geographical and historical, and include  How did early colonial settlement impact the environment? How did colonial people, both free and unfree, form communities in this new place? What are the spatial dimensions of community, and how do they change over time? How did people  living along the Potomac design spaces in response to threats of violence, real or perceived? How did colonists organize domestic spaces to structure or resist unequal social relationships? How were landscapes modified in response to changes in social relations over time? To answer these questions, more site-specific questions also need to be addressed. When was the manor house at 44NB11 constructed, modified, and abandoned? How was the landscape structured immediately around the manor house? What is the evidence of landscape change over time? What do the house, the landscape, and the associated artifacts tell us about conflict and community in early Northumberland County? Goals for summer 2017 Manor house  Uncover, map and excavate a sample of post holes post molds to establish the construction sequence. Sample the western cellar to its base to understand its relationship to the sequence  of construction and to collect artifacts and environmental samples pertinent to the use of space and community formation. Landscape (time permitting)  Excavate a pit northwest of the manor house and locate associated features. Test areas where remote sensing data indicate the presence of additional outbuildings or significant features.

This article deals with the rise of Blount County United, an anti-racist interdenominational Christian organization created to fight racism in Blount County, Tennessee. The other manuscript is for the International Journal of Bahamian Studies and deals with Haitian identity in the Bahamas. Louis is also scheduled to promote My Soul Is in Haiti through book talks at the University of Florida (September 2016) and Virginia Tech (January 2017). De Ann Pendry, senior lecturer, Department of Anthropology De Ann continues to work with the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition (TIRRC) as well as local groups in Knoxville  the immigrant-led Comit   Popular, and a group she helped co-found, the Allies of Knoxville   s Immigrant Neighbors (AKIN). As of early June 2016, these groups were waiting to hear the results of the Supreme Court decision regarding the executive action by President Obama that would allow undocumented parents of children who are US citizens or lawful permanent residents to obtain deferred action and temporary work permits. Pendry recently published    Urgent Need to Address Punitive Immigration Policies    in Practicing Anthropology (38 1 51-53) as part of a discussion among scholars from the United States and Mexico about migration scholarship, which was organized and edited by Judith Friedenberg and Jorge Durand. She will have a chapter on the recent immigrant rights campaigns in Tennessee in Conflict Over Immigration in the United States, and Prospects for Emerging Human Rights, edited by Elaine Levine, Alan LeBaron, and Elaine Lacey, soon to be published by the University of Florida Press. In addition to guest lectures in various classes at UT, she gave presentations on this work at the second Disaster, Displacement, and Human Rights Conference and the annual meetings for the Society for Applied Anthropology and the Latin American Studies Association. She will be publishing the LASA presentation, which dealt with how the immigrant rights movement has been influenced by the civil rights movement in the United States and various human rights movements in Latin America. Pendry will also conduct interviews for a book project on the local immigrant rights groups. In spring 2016, she was invited to give presentations on this work and her research on diabetes among low-income Mexican Americans at two universities in Mexico City. At the same time, she read and participated in a defense of a dissertation by an Iberoamericana University student about Miskitu immigrants from Nicaragua who now live in Port Arthur, Texas. Dawnie Steadman, professor, Department of Anthropology Steaadman is a professor of anthropology and the Director of the Forensic Anthropology Center. She published several articles on bioarchaeology over the past year, including a co-authored paper on ancient tuberculosis in Nature. Working with Professor Hepner and other colleagues, she has also been putting in grants to help support the ongoing human rights work in Uganda. David G. Anderson, professor, Department of Anthropology The National Science Foundation (NSF) Archaeology program awarded funds to expand the Digital Index of North American Archaeology (DINAA) under the direction of David G. Anderson (University of Tennessee, Knoxville  NSF #1623621) and Joshua Wells (Indiana University South Bend  NSF #1623644). This new funding builds upon prior NSF support in 2012 and complements another grant to DINAA awarded from the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) earlier this year to DINAA co-PIs Eric Kansa and Sarah Whitcher Kansa. DINAA is a project to integrate archaeological site file data from across North America, allowing scholars and members of the public alike to examine human settlement across the continent from the Pleistocene through the historic era. The resulting databases and maps have a low spatial resolution to protect site integrity, but otherwise permit, for the first time, the visualization and exploration of human responses to changes in the natural and social environment at local to continental scales over the entire period of human settlement in North America. The data are being used to examine future trends, including the numbers and kinds of heritage resources threatened by sea level rise. The DINAA team is obtaining, indexing, and integrating nonsensitive aspects of the site record in coordination with state, tribal, and federal personnel from across the country, demonstrating how open, collaborative efforts can yield great benefits and foster public support for scientific research. Raja Swamy, assistant professor, Department of Anthropology In addition to continuing work on his first book, tentatively titled Disaster Capitalism  humanitarianism and accumulation by dispossession in post-tsunami Tamil Nadu,    Swamy is completing a manuscript for a special volume of the Journal of World Systems Research focusing on humanitarianism and unequal ecological exchange and a chapter contribution to an edited volume titled Resistance to Contemporary Colonization and Rural Dispossession in South East Asia and Africa. In the coming year, Swamy s will expand his research to focus on the will expand to focus on the relationship between ecological vulnerability and structural violence in coastal regions. Amy Z. Mundorff, associate professor, Department of Anthropology Professor Mundorff, who was recently promoted to associate professor of anthropology, is finishing up a two-year study with scientists at the International Commission on Missing Persons evaluating an easily deployable and economic method for collecting postmortem DNA samples following a mass fatality incident. Recently, Mundorff began a project with Sara Katsanis at Duke University   s Duke Initiative for Science & Society, exploring model language for US-based family reference DNA sample consent forms. This summer, Mundorff   s book chapter,    Forensic Anthropology in Disaster Response,    co-authored with Paul Sledzik of the National Transportation Safety Board, was published in the second edition of Blau & Ubelaker (eds.) Handbook of Forensic Anthropology and Archeology (Routledge, 2016). Barbara J. Heath, associate professor. Department of Anthropology During the summers of 2015 and 2016, UTK graduate and undergraduate students worked on archaeological excavations at Coan Hall on Virginia   s Northern Neck. The team included Henry Alexander, Kendy Altizer, Mark Babin, Dan Brock, Rachel Burgess, Lindsey Cochran, Stephanie Hacker, Charles Mayes, Leslie Muller, Sierra Roark, Eric Schweickart, Samantha Upton, Greg Wehrman, Garrett Womack and Weston Vawter. UTK alumni Crystal O   Connor, Dr. Eleanor Breen, Dr. Brad Hatch   and Dr. Lauren McMillan volunteered along with participants from Mary Washington University, Monticello and Mount Vernon. Sam Upton, Ali Woods, Tiffany Haggard, Leslie Muller, Weston Vawter and Paige Stull worked with the artifacts, samples, and faunal remains from the site in the lab during fall and spring semesters 2015-2016, and participants in a fall seminar on the archaeology of the Chesapeake and Upland South, and in Anth 435 522, Historical Archaeology Laboratory, conducted research relating to the site as part of their coursework. John Mottrom settled on the land now known as Coan Hall sometime between 1638 and 1642. He acquired the property from the Chicacoan tribal werowance (leader) Machywap, with whom he may have had a longstanding relationship as a fur trader. Mottrom   s property became the headquarters of the first English settlement on the Northern Neck, and was named Chicacoan for the tribe that it ultimately displaced. Mottrom   s house became the religious center of the community during his lifetime  the seat of the Northumberland County court by the 1650s  and home to a diverse group that included his kin, his indentured servants, and African men and women who comprised the first wave of laborers to be enslaved in Virginia. Mottrom was closely allied with a faction of Virginians and Marylanders who overthrew the proprietary government of Maryland in 1645, and the two-year-long uprising was organized from the Chicacoan settlement. The complex early history Mottrom   s occupation of the property, and its long-term occupation by his descendants and their servants and enslaved laborers into the early 18th century, provide an important context for studying the material expression of colonialism and its impact on indigenous communities and on the environment  the role of religion in colonial political and economic structures and conflicts  and the development of ideologies of race, and the implementation of racialized systems of labor. We have begun to excavate the remains of the 17th-century post-in-ground manor house and explore the landscape of the early plantation using geophysical prospection and area excavations. We have focused on excavating architectural remains of the house in order to assign a date to its construction  began excavating a cellar on the west end of the house to better understand when the house was abandoned (and the cellar filled) and to collect a sample of artifacts that speak to the material conditions of life at the plantation  and explored areas north and east of the house, where we found evidence of outbuildings and ditches associated with fences or possibly a defensive palisade. On campus, we have been processing artifacts and sediment samples, conducting historical research on the property, and analyzing faunal remains from the cellar. The 2016 field season was supported by a grant from the National Geographic Foundation and by the Department of Anthropology. Student Updates Tiffany Saul Saul, a  doctoral candidate in the Department of Anthropology, is completing research at IsoForensics, Inc., and the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Saul received the Inter-University Training for Continental-scale Ecology (ITCE) Research-in-Residence Award for her proposal titled,    Investigation of the Effects of Decomposition Upon Isotopic Values of Human Hair,    which is part of her dissertation research. Her project is designed to refine the  use of  stable isotopes from human remains to aid in the identification of unknown individuals. Andrea Richardson At the Seventh Annual Undergraduate Research Symposium, Richardson presented a paper titled    The US Justice System, Incarceration, and the Structural Disenfranchisement of Women of Interlocking Identities,    which she wrote for the Anthropology of Justice. In her presentation, Richardson discussed some of the unique injustices faced by women of various marginalized identities. In addition to dealing with mass incarceration and police brutality, women of color and poor women also see their reproductive rights jeopardized and violated by the state. Victims of sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape are often ignored or are even persecuted in courts, never seeing justice, and a significant percentage of women of color have been coercively or unwittingly sterilized. Richardson examined these issues through an intersectional and historical framework and summed up her talk with suggestions for allies who wish to work against these injustices.","link":"http:\/\/anthropology.utk.edu\/disasters-displacement-and-human-rights-program\/updates\/"},{"title":"Position Opening &#8211; Department Chair of the Department of Anthropology","content":"Position Opening &#8211  Department Chair of the Department of Anthropology Position Advertisement The Department of Anthropology at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, the flagship campus of University of Tennessee system, invites applicants for the position of department head with open sub disciplinary specialization.
