Biography
Dr. Howard Alper conducts basic research for the synthesis of compounds of value to the pharmaceutical, petrochemical, and commodity chemical industries. His research group also investigates hydroformylation, ring-expansion carbonylation reactions, as well as stereospecific and highly enantioselective cycloaddition reactions of heterocumulenes. He also explores the activity and recyclability of dendrimer-metal complexes as catalysts, including biomimetic based systems. Recyclable transition metal catalysis using ionic liquids is also pursued by his research group.
