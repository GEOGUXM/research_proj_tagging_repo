Scholarly, Research, and/or Practice Interests
Dr. Jacobs is the founding editor of the interdisciplinary, international journal Work: A Journal of Prevention, Assessment, and Rehabilitation. She has published and presented widely on the topics of ergonomics and marketing. She is the author of Ergonomics for Therapists and Occupational Therapy: Work-Related Programs and Assessments; and coeditor of Quick Reference Dictionary for Occupational Therapy, Occupational Therapy Essentials for Clinical Competence, and AOTA’s OT Manager (5th edition); Dr. Jacobs is the past-president and vice-president of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA)and a Certified Professional Ergonomist (CPE). Dr. Jacobs is a 2005 recipient of The J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship, the 2009 recipient of the Award of Merit from the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists (CAOT), the Award of Merit from the American Occupational Therapy Association in 2003, and the 2011 Eleanor Clarke Slagle Lectureship Award from AOTA. Dr. Jacobs’ research and scholarly pursuits examine the interface between the environment and human capabilities. In particular, she is investigating the individual factors and environmental demands associated with increased risk of functional limitations among populations of university and middle school aged students, particularly in notebook computing, the use of iPad; wearing backpack; and using telehealth technologies to deliver occupational therapy services. She is a co-PI on a 5 year NIDRR with Kent State University, JBS International, Inc., West Virginia University, and Boston University entitled, Project Career: Development of an Interprofessional Demonstration to Support the Transition of Students with Traumatic Brain Injuries from Post secondary Education to Employment. Her research has been supported by grants from the Office Ergonomics Research Committee (OERC) and the Harvard-NIOSH Education and Research Center and gifts from Hewlett Packard and Microsoft.
