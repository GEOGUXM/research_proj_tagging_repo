PhD Project

I am currently pursuing a PhD project at the Department of Cross-Cultural and Regional Studies.
My research project – The Productive Power of the Pipeline - aims at analyzing the impact that extractive industries have had on the negotiation of places, identities and (power) relations in Northern Canada, and more generally in the Arctic, over the last fifty years. By combining a geographical approach with a governmentality analysis, this projects intends to contribute to the current discussion on the opportunities, risks and responsibilities created by energy development and different extractive activities.
The Arctic environment that has been a central element of nation- and region-building, is the same environment now crossed by pipelines which, as I suggest, redesign regions (or entire nations) and trigger phenomenon of cultural translation where communities find themselves relocated in new cultural and geopolitical settings and where something is gained and something is inevitably lost.

Within this context, Canada is identified as a unique and informative case, as the rise of extractive industries has strengthened indigenous engagement, prompting Native groups to come together and take a position on energy development. 

By focusing on the specific case of Mackenzie Gas Project and its advancement from theearly 70s to today, the project argues that the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline (MVP), though eventually unbuilt, has nevertheless triggered a series of long lasting transformations, affecting both people(s) and places.
Ultimately, the aim of this research is to contribute to the scientific field on energy develoment and extractive industries in the Arctic, currently developing with great speed in many scholarly environments, including Copenhagen University.
In particular, since most scholars approach the stages and predicaments of energy and resource development solely in terms of 'impact', I intend to do so by focusing on how places, interests, cultures and peoples are involved as in a process of constant becoming, instead of as something to be taken for granted.
