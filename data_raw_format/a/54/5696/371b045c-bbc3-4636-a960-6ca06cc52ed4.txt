Dr Wei Dai
PhD (Murdoch), BSc (Beijing Inst)
Senior Lecturer, College of Business
Dr Wei Dai worked for about ten years with the Australian Government research organisations including Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and Telecom (now Telstra) Australia Research Laboratories (TRL) as research scientist and project leader.
From 2000 to 2001 he also worked in the private IT industry as a project leader and senior software engineer leading software products development and accumulated real-world commercial experiences before joining Victoria University in 2003.
Since joining Victoria University, he established and coordinated the Phoenix Research Program and has received research grants, research seeding grants, and industry consultancy grants close to $200,000 in total.
Dr Wei Dai serves as a member of Program Committee in the following conferences:
The 26th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA-2012));
IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology (2007 – 2014);
IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (2007 – 2012)
Wei Dai is the recipient of the 2011 international teaching and learning project grant where he led a project in delivering a prototype on-line solution for identifying students at risks. He developed the Phoenix Research Program to ensure the effective links between teaching and research. Consequently, a number of the minor thesis projects and students have benefited under such an initiative. Students have a 6-12 month timeframe to undertake and complete the minor theses.
He has received special recognition for a number of projects including: 
2012 Marquis Who's Who in the World
2011 Winner Cup at the Final Round Chun Hui Cup Competition in China, one of the significant annual event organised jointly by the China's Education Ministry, and the Ministry of Science and Technology.
2009 TIBCO Academic Projects Award.
2007 Third Place Award at the IEEE Services Computing Contest at Salt Lake City, USA.
