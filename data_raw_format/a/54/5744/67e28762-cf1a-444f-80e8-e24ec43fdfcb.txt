Genome-enabled examination of diversity, genome evolution and processes in complex microbial communities
Microbial communities are dynamic and subject not only to competition, predation and environmental perturbation, but extensive genetic adaptation through gene acquisition and exchange. Genome sequencing and related advances have fundamentally altered the field of microbiology, providing an unbiased means to investigate microbes that can both be cultured and those that cannot. Communities such as the mammalian gut however contain a surprising number of cultivable organisms. My lab is interested in leveraging cultivation-based techniques to manipulate individual gut community members and understand the responses of the uncultivable members with genomeenabled technologies. My principle research goals involve in situ examination of (i) microbial diversity and interactions within communities and hosts, and (ii) how these interactions impact bacterial genome evolution.
