Summary
Dr. Nelson is an anatomic and molecular genetic pathologist and is a member of the Division of Molecular Pathology and Genomics.  He earned his doctoral degree in cancer biology and experimental pathology with a focus on cell signaling mechanisms that regulate the function of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in breast and ovarian cancer. He collaborates with colleagues in both clinical and basic research projects involving solid tumor molecular diagnostics.

Research Summary/Interests
Andy was the lead scientist in the design, development, and implementation of the current microfluidics-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform for oncology in the Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory. The current panel tests for over 7,000 important mutations within 21 genes closely linked to the outcome and treatment of various solid and hematologic malignancies. The immediate goal of his work in the area of NGS oncology is to improve quality, turnaround time, logistics and workflow with the current pipeline as well as preparing for further developments in the rapidly advancing field. These efforts include developing tools that provide improved annotation capabilities for therapeutic relevance and clinical trials to in turn provide more value to clinical colleagues and patients. Expansion of the oncology NGS testing will include two major efforts: 1) technical advances to improve testing capability of minuscule biopsy samples, and 2) expanding the number of genes tested to support clinical research efforts at the University.
Current approaches to treating cancer are based primarily on tissue origin and histologic subtypes. Andy sees a major challenge ahead in the integration of genetic information with the traditional tissue-based categorization of cancer. A gene target that responds to therapy in one tissue may not respond to the same therapy in a different tissue, based on the gene’s differing transcriptional and epigenetic profile in the two tissues. Genetic alterations alone cannot explain tumor behavior or a patient’s prognosis. A major challenge for the field is finding a way to integrate knowledge across different platforms that incorporate genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic alterations within the signaling pathways that drive cancer progression.
