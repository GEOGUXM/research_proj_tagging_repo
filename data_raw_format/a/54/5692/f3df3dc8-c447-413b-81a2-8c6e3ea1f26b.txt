Bio-Summary
Before coming to Emory in 2004, Dr. Roser was the director of graduate medical education at New York-Presbyterian Hospital as well as director of the division of oral and maxillofacial surgery and associate dean for hospital affairs at the School of Dental and Oral Surgery of Columbia University.
In 2009, Dr. Roser was the first oral surgeon in Atlanta to use virtual surgery planning for free flap reconstruction following ablative surgery for oral cavity cancer. In September 2011, he received the AAOMS Humanitarian Award during the opening ceremony of the 93rd Annual Meeting of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. The award is presented in recognition of fellows and members of the association who have committed significant time and effort to improving the quality of life for the public.
In addition to his clinical, academic, and research activities, Dr. Roser is a dedicated volunteer who has made many trips to Central and South America as a team leader for Healing the Children to provide such services as cleft lip and cleft palate repair. His most recent trip was to Santa Cruz, Bolivia, in January 2017. In the wake of the January 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti, Dr. Roser was among the first wave of OMS responders to the country.
