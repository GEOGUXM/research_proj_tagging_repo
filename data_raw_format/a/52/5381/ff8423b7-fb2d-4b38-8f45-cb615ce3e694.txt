Biography
Dr Flora Dennis read Music at the University of Cambridge, staying on to do an M.Phil. in Musicology and a Ph.D. on music, printing and the court in sixteenth-century Ferrara. Between 2001 and 2006 she was a Research Fellow at the AHRC Centre for the Study of the Domestic Interior (jointly run by the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Royal College of Art and Royal Holloway, University of London), co-curating the V&A exhibition At Home in Renaissance Italy and contributing to the Centre's Domestic Interiors Database. She was appointed Renaissance Research Fellow attached to the V&A/RCA History of Design Postgraduate Studies Programme in 2006, and was the 2006-07 Sussex/V&A Exchange Fellow.
She joined the Art History Department at Sussex in September 2007 and spent 2007-08 in Florence as a Research Fellow at Villa I Tatti, the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies, working on a project entitled 'Music, Sound and Domestic Space in Italy, 1450-1620'. She was awarded an AHRC Early Career Fellowship (2010-11) and a fellowship at The Italian Academy, Columbia University (Autumn 2011) to complete the monograph 'Music, Art and Objects in the Italian Renaissance Home'.
An Honorary Research Fellow of the Research Department of the V&A (2007-11), Dr Dennis was also the Sussex Exchange Fellow at the V&A from 2008 to 2010. She co-instigated 'The Listening Gallery', an AHRC-funded Knowledge Transfer collaboration between the V&A and the Royal College of Music, recording music for the new Medieval and Renaissance galleries (the recordings are available online here and a short film about the use of her research for the project is available here). She is on the editorial boards of Renaissance Studies and Early Music History.
