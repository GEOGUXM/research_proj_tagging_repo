Biographical Sketch
Prof. Harrity obtained his BSc (Hons.) in Chemistry from the University of Strathclyde in 1991, followed by a PhD from the same institution in 1994. He was a  Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Boston College, USA from 1994 to 1997, after which he became a Lecturer at the University of Sheffield. Here he was promoted to Senior Lecturer and Reader. He was promoted to Professor in 2009. In October 2012, Prof. Harrity was appointed to a 3 year Royal Society Industry Fellowship to undertake a collaboration with Peakdale Molecular. He will work with Peakdale to develop novel functionalised intermediates on commercially relevant scales, thereby introducing new scaffolds into their catalogue portfolio.
