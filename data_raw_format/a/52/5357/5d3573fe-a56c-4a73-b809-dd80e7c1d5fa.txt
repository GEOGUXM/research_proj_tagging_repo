About me

I am a geographer who started a PhD in volcanic risk assessment in 2012. My research focuses on (1) improving existing models for simulating lava flows and developing an open-source plugin for assessing lava flow hazard, (2) using remote sensing techniques to map and assess exposure to volcanic hazards (population and infrastructure) and (3) sensitizing populations at risk to the concept of disaster through the development of a serious game.
My expertise includes:
Volcanic risk assessment
Python programming
Lava flow simulation
Serious games
Urban remote sensing with high-resolution satellite images
