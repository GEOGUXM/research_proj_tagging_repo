Summary
Qualifications
Biography
In my career as a midwife over the past 15 years I have worked in a variety setting of the public hospitals in the ACT and a stint in private practice in New Zealand. I continue to work for Calvary Health Care providing care to women birthing in the ACT.
I have enjoyed the shift in career to the University of Canberra and its stimulating environment.  Watching and working with the students as they develop into thoughtful and confident new midwives is a challenge and a joy.
