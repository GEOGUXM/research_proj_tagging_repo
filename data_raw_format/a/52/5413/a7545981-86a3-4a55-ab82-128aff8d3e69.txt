Nancy Brooks does research centering on policy-oriented theoretical and empirical microeconomics with an emphasis on environmental and urban/regional economics. Her focus is multidisciplinary, overlapping with geography, regional science, and sociology. Specifically, she is interested in the implications, for equity and efficiency, of various types of externalities -- instances where the costs or benefits of an economic transaction are imposed on someone who is not part of the transaction. Prior to coming to Cornell, Professor Brooks was a faculty member in the Department of Economics at the University of Vermont (U.V.M.). At U.V.M., she was active in service-learning teaching on the topic of local economic development and is currently co-editing the Oxford University Press Handbook of Urban Economics and Planning. She has published in Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, and Journal of Economic Education. Professor Brooks teaches the CIPA core foundation courses CRP 5122: Intermediate Microeconomics for Public Affairs and CRP 5450: Inferential Statistics for Planning and Public Policy. She received her Ph.D. in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1995.
