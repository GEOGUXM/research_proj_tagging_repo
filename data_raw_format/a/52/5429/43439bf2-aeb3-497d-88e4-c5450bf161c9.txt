Locomotor Control Lab
In the Locomotor Control Lab, we seek to understand how locomotion is controlled and adapted in both the healthy and injured neuromuscular system. We develop theoretical models and experiments based on principles of neuroscience, biomechanics, engineering, and exercise physiology to identify the factors that guide locomotor learning and rehabilitation. Ultimately, the goal of our work is to design novel and effective interventions to improve walking ability in individuals with damage to the nervous system. The lab is directed by James M. Finley, PhD, Assistant Professor in the Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy.
