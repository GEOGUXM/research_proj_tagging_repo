Profile
Professor Pamela O’Connor joined the USC Law School in August 2014. Previously she worked for more than 20 years in the Faculty of Law at Monash University, most recently as Associate Dean (Education) (2011, 2013-14). Before becoming an academic, she practised law in Victoria for 11 years, working with Fitzroy Legal Service and Victoria Legal Aid.
Professor O’Connor has an international reputation for her publications in property law and has advised law reform commissions in England, Scotland and New Zealand. In 2009-10 she led the Victorian Law Reform Commission’s work on two reports to complete its reference on reform of property laws. She is a co-recipient of four ARC research grants, including a current cross-institutional project (with QUT) on carbon property rights. She is also an Adjunct Professor at Monash University, where she is a team member for the 'Better Regulatory Frameworks for Water Sensitive Cities' project in the CRC for Water Sensitive Cities.
Professor O’Connor has undertaken 5 research projects funded by public sector bodies, and has held senior government appointments as a member of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Commonwealth Legal Aid Advisory Committee, as a Victorian Law Reform Commissioner, and as a Board member of the Leo Cussen Institute and the Judicial College of Victoria.
She currently represents the Law School on the University's Research Management Committee, Research Degrees Committee and HDR Coordinators Committee and is the Law School's HDR Coordinator.
