Professor Mark Spottswood focuses his research on the design of fact-finding environments, investigating how we might make civil and criminal litigation more accurate, more acceptable and more cost-effective through reforms to the rules of procedure and evidence. He teaches Evidence, Civil Procedure, Scientific Evidence, and Advanced Civil Procedure. After graduating first in his class at Northwestern Law, he clerked for both the Honorable Jeffrey S. Sutton, United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and the Honorable Rebecca R. Pallmeyer, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
