Profile
Prof Anstey's substantive research interests include the epidemiology of cognition and dementia with a focus on identifying lifestyle, brain, and biological risk factors for cognitive decline, and the impact of cognitive ageing on everyday function and driving. She is also interested intra-individual variability as a marker of brain and cognitive impairment, and how meta-cognition influences everyday function in later life.
Other research interests focus on the development of wellbeing, depression and suicidality over the lifecourse. Methodological interests include meta-analysis, multilevel modeling, and combining dataset using harmonization. Kaarin is also interested in cross-national differences in ageing and health, and how this relates to lifestyle, social and policy differences between countries.
