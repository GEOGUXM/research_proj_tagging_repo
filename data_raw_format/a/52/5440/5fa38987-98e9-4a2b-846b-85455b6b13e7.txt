Research and teaching activities:
Major interests and research areas are the aetiology and clinical treatment of obesity, including the role of diet and behaviour, genetics and gene-nutrient interaction on body weight and risk factors for type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Other studies have addressed human physiology and patho-physiology of energy, substrate metabolism and appetite regulation, including the interaction with the development of obesity and associated risk factors. Recent major research efforts have been in conducting long-term human dietary intervention studies, specifically the role of diet composition and behaviour modification for weight loss, weight maintenance, risk factors for type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and drop out rate.
