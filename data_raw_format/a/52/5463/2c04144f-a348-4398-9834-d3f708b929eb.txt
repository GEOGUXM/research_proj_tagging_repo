Biography: 
My career has been extremely varied and when asked what my expertise is in I generally reply I am a geological general practioner.  I graduated as a palaeontologist, moved into petroleum and coal geology, my PhD was in carbonate sedimentology and palaeoecology.  I have also worked on marine surveys in the Southern and Indian Oceans, explored for base metals, nickel and gold in Archaean and Proterozoic terranes in South and western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland, as well as for gold and copper in the Philippines and Chile.  More recently I have been working on the evolution of Australian landscapes, especially of the arid interior and its regolith, on the sedimentology and architecture of Australian Cainozoic basins, and aquifer characterisation and salinity mapping in Australian depositional landscapes.
I have been researching in two main fields, terrestrial analogues of Martian landscapes and developing exploration strategies for human missions to Mars.  Particular analogue landscapes I am interested in include the Hanksville area in Utah, the Arkaroola region in South Australia, areas of inverted relief throughout Australia, and groundwater-related landforms of Australian mound springs, especially those at Dalhousie.   Exploration strategies for human missions is through integrated field research of instruments (spectrometers, data capture, geophysical tools), methodologies (scouting, navigation), exploration technologies (suits, living modules, rovers, field robotics), at appropriate levels of simulation fidelity.  These inform and define baseline requirements and capabilities of human Mars missions and have been particularly useful in the development of the Mars Oz reference mission, a low mass, high return four person Mars mission utilising chemical propulsion and solar power.
