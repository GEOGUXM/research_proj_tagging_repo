About
Most of my research and teaching focuses on the social psychology of men’s sexuality/reproduction, fathering, and paid/volunteer work with children outside the home. In general, I am interested in how men socially construct their identities as persons capable of creating and caring for human life in various settings. My books include:
Dads, Kids, and Fitness: A Father’s Guide to Family Health (2016).  New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press.
The Male Clock: A Futuristic Novel about a Fertility Crisis, Gender Politics, and Identity (2015, with Kendra Siler-Marsiglio).
Nurturing Dads: Social Initiatives for Contemporary Fatherhood (2012, with Kevin Roy)
Men on a Mission: Valuing Youth Work in Our Communities (2008)
Situated Fathering: A Focus on Physical and Social Spaces (Ed. with Kevin Roy and Greer Litton Fox, 2005)
Stepdads: Stories of Love, Hope, and Repair (2004)
Sex, Men, and Babies: Stories of Awareness and Responsibility (with Sally Hutchinson, 2002)
Procreative Man (1998)
Fatherhood: Contemporary Theory, Research, and Social Policy (Ed. 1995).
Since 2000, my research has been based on qualitative in-depth interviews. My most recent book, Dads, Kids, and Fitness focuses on the intersection of health issues for fathers and their children and is grounded in interviews with dads and pediatric health care professionals as well as autoethnographic observations. My 2012 book integrates data from seven different qualitative studies to explore the prospects for developing a wide range of social initiatives that encourage fathers to be more attentive and responsive to their children. In my 2008 book I focused on men’s experiences working with children in diverse areas (e.g., coaches, teachers, youth ministers, probation officers, Big Brothers, Boy Scout leaders, 4-H club leaders, youth intervention specialists). One facet of this project examined how youth work and fathering mutually influence one another. Another study with teenage and young adult men focused on how they described their romantic relationships, sex lives, and procreative experiences. It provided the foundation for my Procreative Identity Framework—a model exploring how men become aware of their ability to procreate and its meaning for them over time. My research with stepfathers considered how they develop and manage their involvement with stepchildren and the “family” network (mother, biological father, own children). I am also interested in how physical and social spaces affect fathers’ identity work and involvement with their children.
Currently, I am in the early phases of developing a book that focuses on various aspects of youth triathlon as a sport and community experience. I’m also expanding two web-based projects. Dads & Kids: Health & Fitness Talk (http://www.dadsandkidshealth.com/) and (https://www.facebook.com/dadsandkidshealth). The former and main site is an interactive web resource to inform and inspire individuals committed to promoting healthy lifestyles for fathers and children. It targets parents—especially dads, youth and young adults, as well as professionals working with kids in the community including health care providers, coaches, teachers, youth ministers, Big Brothers, and the like.
