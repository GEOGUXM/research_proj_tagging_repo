SUMMARY
Yuri Mishina is an assistant professor of organisational behavior/strategy in the Organisation & Management Group at Imperial College Business School. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in organizational theory with a minor in strategic management. He also has an MBA from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a B.A. in economics from the University of Chicago. Prior to joining Imperial College, he was an assistant professor of management at Michigan State University.
His research examines informal corporate governance processes, and in particular, how top management team and stakeholder belief systems influence a firm’s strategic choices and outcomes. In order to do so, he draws upon a variety of literatures to uncover how social evaluations (e.g., reputations, stigma), expectations, and the cognitive biases of managers may influence illegal activities, executive compensation, and firm performance. Some of his current projects include: a study of how the use of emotional language in a firm’s corporate communications can influence beliefs about the firm’s worth, an examination of how firm performance feedback may influence CEO cognitions, an exploration of how corporate social performance and illegal activities can influence firm performance, and a study of why some supergroups (i.e., rock all-star bands) are more successful than others. His research has been published in the Academy of Management Journal, Organization Science, and Strategic Management Journal and he is currently an editorial review board member of the Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, and Strategic Management Journal and an International Research Fellow of the Oxford University Centre for Corporate Reputation.
