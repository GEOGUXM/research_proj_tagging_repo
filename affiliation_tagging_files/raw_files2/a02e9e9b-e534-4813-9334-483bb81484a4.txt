Tory Hendry earned a B.A. in Biology from Williams College and a Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. For her dissertation she worked with Dr. Paul Dunlap on genomic evolution in luminous symbionts. She has held postdoctoral appointments at the University of Arizona working with Dr. David Baltrus and as a USDA NIFA Fellow working with Dr. Nicholas Mills and Dr. Steven Lindow at the University of California, Berkeley.
Research Focus
Bacterial interactions with eukaryotic hosts can have dramatic consequences for both bacteria and hosts. Research in the Hendry lab focuses on understanding how host interactions influence bacterial evolution and ecology, and how these processes then impact hosts. We answer these questions using a diverse range of systems and both genomic and experimental methods.

For instance, luminous bacteria are members of the family Vibrionaceae, a diverse bacterial group including many host-associated, pathogenic, and symbiotic members. Comparative genomics has been a powerful tool for elucidating evolutionary and host-interaction differences among these bacteria.

Another research focus is on the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. Though P. syringae is a common plant pathogen, it also lives in many other environments including on plant surfaces and inside some insects, where it can cause disease. We use naturally occurring diversity in P. syringae strains to study interactions with varied habitats and hosts.

Work in the lab also focuses on how bacterial interactions influence hosts. Examples of this research include direct experiments on how P. syringae affects insects and collaborations with other labs on the ecology of insect microbiomes.
