Yi Zhu received his PhD in Business Administration from the University of Southern California (USC) in 2013. He worked as a consultant at Shanghai Investment Consulting Corporation before he went to Vancouver, where he received his M.A. in Economics from University of British Columbia. His research interests focus on the application of industrial organization models in marketing, online auctions, search advertising, media slant, and Chinese economy. His recent works have appeared or forthcoming at Marketing Science, Management Science, Journal of Marketing Research and International Journal of Research in Marketing. He serves as ad hoc reviewers for several top business journals and international conferences, including Marketing Science, Management Science, Journal of Marketing Research, Information Systems Research, MIS Quarterly, Operations Research, Production and Operations Management, Journal of Economics & Management Strategy, Marketing Letters, International Conference on Information Systems, Hong Kong Research Grant Council, and others. 
In 2015, Zhu is the recipient of the John D.C. Little Award for the best marketing paper published in Marketing Science or Management Science, and the finalist for the Frank M. Bass Award for the best marketing paper derived from a Ph.D. thesis published in INFORMS journals. In 2016, he has been selected as a 2017 Marketing Science Institute (MSI) Young Scholar, a biennial award given to the most promising scholars in marketing who have distinguished themselves as potential leaders of the next generation of marketing academics. Zhu also won Shankar-Spiegel Best Dissertation Proposal Award in 2012. His research was funded by 3M Non-Tenured Faculty Grant, the Marketing Science Institute Grant, Net Institute Grant, CIBER dissertation Grant, Carlson Dean's Small Research Grant, and Dean's Research Travel Grant.  Zhu has also won the 2011 James S. Ford/Commerce Associates Ph.D. Fellowship and many other awards during his time at USC. Among the 2013 graduates at USC, Zhu was one of the six awardees of the 2013 USC PhD Achievement Award.  In addition, Zhu was recognized by the Chinese Ministry of Education to be one of the top nine Chinese doctoral students studying abroad for his outstanding academic achievement and research in 2012 —among all graduate students across all subjects.
