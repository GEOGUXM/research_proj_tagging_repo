Introduction
Mariya has joined Macquarie University as a Research Fellow at the Science of Learning Research Centre in 2014. In her current role she is working on project exploring connections between confusion, self-regulation and feedback in digital learning environments. Previously she worked as an instructional technologist at various higher education settings and in the industry. Mariya has a broad teaching experience ranging from teaching educational psychology and instructional multimedia unis to preparing and conducing workshops on quantitative research methods. During her PhD at UNSW, which she successfully completed in 2013, she was working with Prof. John Sweller and Prof. Slava Kalyuga on investigating an expertise development in well-structured domains on examples of secondary mathematics classrooms. Marya's research interests include online learning, instructional multimedia, educational psychology, memory and learning processes.
