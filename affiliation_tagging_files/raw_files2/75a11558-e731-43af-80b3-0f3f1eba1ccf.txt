Professional Interests:
Dr. Yeh received the Ph.D. degree in Cell Biology with concentration in Neuroscience from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. His research interests are in the neurosciences. Specifically, his research revolves around issues related to the functions of neurotransmitter systems and neurotrophins in the normal and diseased brain. There are several research programs ongoing in his laboratory. One of the research programs investigates the role of GABA as a developmental neurotransmitter in regulating neuronal migration and synapse formation at embryonic stages of corticogenesis. This project has been extended to examining the enduring effects of maternal ethanol (alcohol) consumption on brain development in the offspring. Another research program seeks to delineate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying altered synaptic plasticity within the septohippocampal system, including the actions of neurotransmitters and neurotrophins. All of the research projects combine experimental approaches that include electrophysiology, neuroanatomy, biochemistry and molecular biology. Overall, these projects have laid the groundwork for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to develop and elaborate on their own research interests and directions.
Dr. Yeh has taught actively in the medical school and graduate school curricula, and has leadership roles in directing graduate education and training at the institutional and national levels.
Rotations and Thesis Projects:
All rotation and thesis projects reflect the multidisciplinary approach taken in my laboratory. For rotations, the nature of the projects are necessarily of more limited scope because on concomitant coursework. Students can expect to conduct focused short-term hypothesis-driven projects that will allow them to become familiar with at least one of the following approaches:
Molecular biology: quantitative RT-PCR and/or candidate gene profiling in single cells.
Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy; Western blot/ELISA.
Electrophysiology: patch clamp recording and/or extracellular field potential recording.
Specific examples of rotation projects that involve one or more of the above approaches:
1. Does binge drinking ethanol early in pregnancy have enduring effects on the development of the fetal cerebral cortex?
2. What is the expression profile of GABAA receptor subunits in GABAergic cortical interneuronal subpopulations?
3. Are Cajal-Retzius cells tonically excited by an ambient level of GABA during cortical development?
4. Do Cajal Retzius cells release transmitter, such as GABA or glutamate?
5. Does an acute exposure to ethanol affect excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the medial septum?

Interested students are encouraged to meet with Dr. Yeh and discuss rotation projects tailored to their interests.
