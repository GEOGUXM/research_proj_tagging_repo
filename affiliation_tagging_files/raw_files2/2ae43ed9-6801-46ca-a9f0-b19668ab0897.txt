My Research Interests
The history of human relations around trade, exchange and cultural encounter, with related interests in human encounters within the wild world: how the meaning of wildlife has changed in time, and how humanity has interacted with, found inspiration in, and frequently commodified in trade the wild things around them. Keyword research: fur trade and industry, modernity and animals, the North, Native history, parks, and sports hunting and angling.
My current SSHRC-funded research project examines Treaty Trade: how relations between treaty Indians and newcomers were monetized with cash treaty bonuses and annuities. I am particularly interested in comparing changing modes of exchange occuring at sites of the traditional and ongoing fur trade in Western Canada in the period of the Numbered Treaties of the 19th and early 20th century.
