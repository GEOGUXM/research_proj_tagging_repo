David Carchedi, Assistant Professor of Mathematics
I am an assistant professor of mathematics at George Mason University.
I completed my PhD in 2011 under the supervision of Ieke Moerdijk at Utrecht University, in the Netherlands. My thesis title was "Categorical Properties of Topological and Differentiable Stacks."

A central theme of my research is applications of higher category theory to topology and differential and algebraic geometry. In particular, I am interested in derived geometry. I also maintain an active interest in field theory.
I am currently involved in many different research projects. One of the larger endeavors I am working on is an active collaboration with Dima Roytenberg centered around modeling derived manifolds using differential graded manifolds. I am also working with Hiro Tanaka on extended these ideas to the infinite dimensional setting.

Positions
I was a postdoc with Kai Behrend at the University of British Columbia from 2014-2015.
I was a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics from 2011-2014.
I was a Visiting Scholar at UC Berkeley from Jan.-May of 2014 with Alan Weinstein.
I was a Visiting Scholar at MIT during the summers of 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013.
Before starting my PhD at Utrecht, I spent a year in Utrecht as a participant in the Master Class in Symplectic Geometry from 2006-2007.
I also participated quite a bit in the Master Class in Calabi-Yau Geometry from 2008-2009.
In Fall of 2002, I was a participant in the "Math in Moscow Program."
