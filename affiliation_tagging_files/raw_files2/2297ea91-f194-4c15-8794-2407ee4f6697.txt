Funding and awards
In August 2009, I travelled to the 10th biennial meeting of the Society for Geology Applied to Mineral Deposits (SGA) in Townsville, Queensland, Australia, where I received the prestigious SGA-Barrick Young Scientist award. This award is offered biennially to a young scientist who contributed significantly to the understanding of mineral deposits. The award consists of a citation, prize money of EUR 1500, and travel to the Biennial meeting for the presentation.

Research
Research Group: Volcanoes, Tectonics and Mineral Resources Research Group
My interests in research are in the nature and genesis of magmatic and hydrothermal precious metal deposits, and the implications for mineral exploration, using a variety of geochemical and mineralogical techniques.
Current interests are focused on the Cu-Ni-PGE ore deposits in the Bushveld Complex, South Africa, and in Tertiary intrusions in the North Atlantic region, including the world famous Skaergaard intrusion, east Greenland.
Other current research projects focus on hydrothermal gold mineralisation in coastal Chile, the Scottish Dalradian, iron oxide-copper-gold deposits in Australia and Mauritania and the Archaean of east Greenland. This includes the development of 3D X-ray Computed Tomography techniques in mineralogical analysis. Many of these projects include the involvement of industrial partners.
