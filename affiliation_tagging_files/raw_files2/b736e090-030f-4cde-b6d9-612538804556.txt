Biographical details
Angela is a Nephrologist and Transplant Physician, having trained in England, Scotland and Australia. She studied Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Sydney, and was awarded a PhD for her thesis Immunosuppression and malignancy in End Stage Kidney Disease in 2006. She now splits her time working as a Staff Specialist in Renal Medicine and Transplantation at Westmead Hospital and as an Associate Professor in Clinical Epidemiology in the Sydney School of Public Health. She is the Executive Officer of the Australian and New Zealand Islet and Pancreas Transplant Registry, a member of the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant registry (ANZDATA) Cancer working group and of the New South Wales Transplant Advisory Committee. She is Chair of the Scientific Program and Education Committee (SPEC) of the Australian and New Zealand Society of Nephrology. Angela is funding arbiter for Cochrane, and from 2007-2015 was deputy coordinating editor of the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant, where she remains an Editor.

Research interests
Angela's areas of research interest include the critical exploration of randomized trial methodology, the evaluation of diagnostic tests in clinical practice, the application of advanced statistical concepts in meta-analysis, the manipulation and analysis of large datasets, the methods and application of linkage of large national databases, and design and interpretation of cohort studies. She has an interest in research integrity in biomedical publishing.
Her research themes include the interaction of chronic diseases, specifically chronic kidney disease, with cancer and with cardiovascular disease including stroke. She has an interest in the cognitive effects of chronic diseases, and the impact this has on health. She is interested in ways to promote self-management to help people live well with chronic disease
