Profile
My research interests are in the area of developmental psycholinguistics. My research looks at language development in both typical and atypical populations. I use three approaches in the study of language development: (i) integrating theoretical and experimental perspectives, (ii) a cross-linguistic approach (i.e., language development in both English- and Mandarin-speaking children), and (iii) combining behavioural (e.g., eye tracking) and neuroimaging techniques (e.g., MEG). My current projects investigate language development in Mandarin-speaking children with autism.
