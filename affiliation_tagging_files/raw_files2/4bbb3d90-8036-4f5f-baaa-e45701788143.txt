Jon Matthews graduated in 2010 from the Radboud University Nijmegen with a Masters degree in Environmental Science specialising in water management. The results of his masters thesis focussing on river restoration were published in the scientific journal Hydrobiologia. Since then, he has worked at Alterrra, Wageningen, examining the hydromorphological and biological processes that occur as a result of the remeandering of rivers. Since February 2011, Jon has been employed as a junior researcher within the Department of Environmental Science of the Radboud University Nijmegen.
Research Work
Since 2004, the non-indiginous Quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) has been established in Dutch freshwaters. Since this time, it has demonstrated a rapid ability in colonisation, and has been defined as an invasive species. The Quagga mussel is now found to be present in greater densities than the invasive Zebra mussel (Dreissenna polymorpha) at a number of sampling points. In certain areas a very high density of individuals has been observed that threaten indigenous mussel types and other indigenous freshwater fauna.
It has been observed that Quaggas demonstrate a higher level of bioaccummulation than Zebra mussels, presenting an increased risk of toxicity to animals that feed off these species. In North America, Quaggas have demonstrated similar and sometimes greater impacts on the aquatic ecosystem than Zebra mussels. Additionally, effects of colonisation on the functionality of structures such as cooling installations and ships lead to economic losses. It is expected that in the future, in Dutch waters the Quagga mussel will become more abundant than the Zebra mussel.
Currently, little is known of the potential spread, colonisation speed and steering variables that effect the spread and density of these species. Knowledge regarding these factors can be used to better understand the ecological, economic and human health impacts of further colonisation by the Quagga. Additionally, potential methods of intervention to reduce the impact of this species could be developed. The current research project aims to fill these gaps in knowledge and provide recommendations for management by examining present physiological tolerance and population data, and providing additional data through field work.
