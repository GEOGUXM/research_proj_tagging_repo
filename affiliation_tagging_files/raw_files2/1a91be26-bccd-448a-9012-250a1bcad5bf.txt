About me
I arrived in Perth and started work at Murdoch in mid-January, 2016. I am actively looking for strong PhD students to supervise. Please check my research areas and publications and if you are interested to collaborate with me, contact me at p.koutsakis@murdoch.edu.au
A few words about me: I received my 5-year Diploma in Electrical Engineering in 1997 from the University of Patras, Greece and my Ph.D. degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering in 2002 from the Technical University of Crete, Greece. I was a Visiting Lecturer at the Electronic and Computer Engineering Department of the same University for three years (2003-2006).
From July 2006 till December 2008 I was an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of McMaster University, Canada. In January 2009 I joined the School of Electronic and Computer Engineering of the Technical University of Crete, as an Assistant Professor, and in April 2014 I received tenure as an Associate Professor in the School.
I am a Senior Member of the IEEE. I have been honoured three times (2012, 2013, 2015) as Exemplary Editor of the IEEE Communications Society, for my work as an Editor of the IEEE Communication Surveys and Tutorials Journal.
I have served as Primary Investigator and as Deputy Coordinator for a number of Canadian, European and Greek research projects.
