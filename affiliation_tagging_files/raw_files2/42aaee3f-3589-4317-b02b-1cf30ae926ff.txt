Chung Tin is currently an Assistant Professor in Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering at City University of Hong Kong. He received his BEng. degree (1st Class) from University of Hong Kong in Mechanical Engineering in 2002. He then moved to the United States and obtained his S.M. and PhD. degrees, both in Mechanical Engineering, from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in 2004 and 2011, respectively. He continues as a postdoctoral associate in MIT until he returned to Hong Kong in 2012. He has been awarded Croucher Foundation Scholarship (HK), American Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowship, and Early Career Award (Research Grant Council, Hong Kong). His research interests include neural prosthetic systems, brain-machine interface, neural computation and sensorimotor learning and control.
