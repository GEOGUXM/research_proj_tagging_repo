  Dr Andrew W. H. Ip has more than 30 years of experience in teaching, research, education, industry and consulting. He received his PhD from Loughborough University (U.K.), MBA from Brunel University (U.K.), MSc in Industrial Engineering from Cranfield University (U.K.), and LLB (Hons) from the University of Wolverhampton (U.K.). After finishing postgraduate degrees in industrial engineering in the U.K., he came back to Hong Kong in the early 80s. His engineering research career began at that time with novel work in Industrial Engineering, Information Systems and Management Science.
  He is now Associate Professor in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and member of the senior management group of the department that oversees the Logistics Engineering and Quality Service Theme Group. Dr Ip is also Associate Director of Integrated Graduate Development Scheme (IGDS) - a jointly-awarded Master degree programme with The University of Warwick (U.K.). He is responsible for admission matters, project supervision and developing the multi-disciplinary teaching and learning approach to nurture world-class engineering business professionals for global industries.
  He is also the Lab-in-charge of the RFID Solutions Laboratory (formerly known as M-commerce Demonstration Unit) of the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering which hosts over HK$10 million worth of software and equipment related to RFID and wireless sensor networks. The laboratory has over the years obtained around HK$35 million funding support from industry and government, achieved much recognition from industry, such as international awards, patents and research outputs. In 2015, he and his research team are awarded “Gold Medal with the Congratulations of Jury” and “Thailand Award for Best International Invention from The National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT)” in the 43rd International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva. And in 2013, he obtained Natural Science Award - Second Class, presented by the Ministry of Education of Mainland China. As a principal investigator, Dr Ip has obtained over HK$22 million external R&D grants including the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) with matching funds from Towngas Telecommunications Fixed Network Limited, Sino Parking Services Limited and V-Care Development Limited, the Teaching Company Scheme (TCS), research donations, collaborative research projects and General Research Fund grant.
  In addition, Dr Ip has published nearly 240 papers with over 130 papers in SCI indexed journals, and also over 130 papers in conference proceedings, and has written books and invited book chapters.
