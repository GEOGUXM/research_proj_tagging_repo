Lecturer, School of Engineering and Information Technology
About me
I am currently the Academic Chair for the Internetworking and Network Security Major.
I teach a variety of network design units at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. While I have a research interest in many aspects of networking and security my focus is on the use HF as a medium for wireless sensor networks.
I also hold an ACMA AOCP(A) radio licence which I use in conjunction with my research activities.  My call sign is VK6KOZ.
