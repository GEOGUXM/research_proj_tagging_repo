Viscoelastic flow Modelling for Polymer Flooding
S. (Shauvik) De, J.T. (Johan) Padding, E.A.J.F (Frank) Peters, J.A.M. (Hans) Kuipers
Polymer liquids are used in the oil industry to improve the volumetric sweep efficiency and displacement efficiency of the oil from a reservoir. Surprisingly, is it not only the viscosity but also the elastic properties of the displacing fluid that determine the displacement efficiency. This may be caused by the ability of a viscoelastic fluid to pull oil out of dead-ends. The objective of the project is to develop a computer simulation methodology for the flow of non-Newtonian fluids through porous media. This will enable us to gain a fundamental understanding of the effects of fluid elasticity and interfacial tension between the oil phase and the displacing fluid on the recovery efficiencies.
The main aim of the work is to develop an advanced computer simulation methodology for the flow of non-Newtonian fluids through porous media. This computational model will provide insights to the influence of polymers on oil flow in reservoirs, and thus provide a detailed understanding on recovery process optimization, polymer selection and improving displacement efficiency in reservoirs.
