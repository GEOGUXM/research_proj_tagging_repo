Personal Summary
Having grown up in the Chicago area and later in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan near the shores of Lake Superior, I traveled west to the mountains in search of more cold and snow, which I didn't find. Nevertheless, I have made my family and career in this lovely state. After 10 years of high school teaching, I finished my PhD in Classics, and, Deo gratias, found an adjunct professorship at The University of Montana. Twenty-six years later and a tenured professor,  I am  retired. My wife and I have in Bigfork (MT) a small hobby farm, populated by horses, sheep, donkeys, walk-on cats, and our dogs. Life and work have been a wonderful blessing here in Missoula. I am teaching autumn, 2010, on a post-retirement contract.
