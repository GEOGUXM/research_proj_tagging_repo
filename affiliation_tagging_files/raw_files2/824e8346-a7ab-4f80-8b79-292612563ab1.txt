Profile
Professor Pourkashanian is the Head of University Energy Research at the University of Sheffield and Director of the Pilot-scale Advanced Capture Technology (PACT) national facilities. He is a Professor of Energy Engineering and has completed numerous major research projects on clean energy technology and has received a substantial sum of grants from RCUK-EPSRC, EU, NATO, and industry. He has published over 446 refereed research papers and has co-authored books on coal combustion. He played a leading role in developing the NOx post-processing computer codes and subsequently soot/NOx models that were later employed in the commercial CFD software. He is a member of numerous international and national scientific bodies including a member of EERA Implementation Plan 2013-2015 (contribution to CCS-EII Team, SET-PLAN), a member of Coordinating Group of UKCCSRC, an invited member of the All Party Parliamentary Renewable Transport Fuels Group, member of technical working group for the Department of Energy & Climate Change (CCS Roadmap UK2050) and Expert-Member in EU-GCC Clean Gas Energy Network.
