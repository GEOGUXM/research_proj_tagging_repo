Research Interests
My research integrates several disciplines, ranging from chemical oceanography to animal behavior and has centered on understanding the sensory ecology of marine organisms. Fish and squid aggregation behaviors serve a fundamental ecological function, driving foraging and spawning events. The sensory cues which these animals utilize for locating relevant habitats and timing aggregations are only beginning to be revealed. My research has specifically targeted understanding the use of chemical cues in driving these behaviors. Along these lines, I have investigated dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) as an intriguing chemical cue, because it is ubiquitous in the marine environment and connected to plankton foraging cascades. My work as a graduate student showed for the first time that planktivorous fish will aggregate to, and pelagic, piscivorous fish are associated with, pulses of DMSP. This work merely scratched the surface of understanding the role DMSP plays in the sensory ecology of marine organisms.
My postdoctoral studies, working with the National Marine Sanctuaries (USA) and the Smithsonian Institution (USA) focused more specifically on the reef habitats which serve as aggregation hotspots and help create the chemical seascape. Working with the National Marine Sanctuary Program, I have also gained a more specialized experience of coordinating federal government agencies, non-governmental conservation organizations, scientists and the general public through various projects centered around marine reserve design and implementation. With the Smithsonian, I specifically investigated the chemical ecology of plankton-based fish foraging aggregations over coral reefs, trying to unravel the complex suite of chemical cues fish use to locate foraging hotspots.
As an Adjunct Research Fellow with the Catchment to Reef Research Group, I am expanding my research into understanding plankton dynamics, and associated chemical cues, driven by nutrient enrichment of the coastal and reef seascape, and the concomitant effects throughout the food web, as well as investigating mitigation strategies for reducing the nutrient footprint of the catchment on these systems.
