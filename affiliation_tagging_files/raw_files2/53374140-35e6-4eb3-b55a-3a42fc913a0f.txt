Bio:
After spending five years in private practice, Wayne Gazur first joined the faculty of the University of Colorado as a lecturer in business and law. He became an associate professor in a joint position between the College of Business and Administration and the Law School in 1990.

He is now a full professor appointed to the Law School. He was named a Charles Inglis Thomson Fellow in 1999. His educational background and research efforts are concentrated in the area of taxation, including estate and business planning.
