Areas of Interest
Evolution and ecology of mycorrhizal fungi, plant-fungi symbioses, diversity of root fungi, using electronic media to promote education and citizen science.
Research
The evolutionary history of mycorrhizal fungi and their plant partners goes as far back as the origin of land plants. I am interested in how this association influences diversification and specialization of mycorrhizal fungi and their hosts. I use phylogenetic and network analyses to detangle the complexity of mycorrhizal networks and want to understand how these contribute to ecosystem functioning and maintenance of species diversity.
I advocate for citizen science and open access to scientific data. Currently, collaborators and I are developing a citizen science project that focuses on mycorrhizal fungi from tropical rain forests. The aim is to engage the public in research and provide information about root fungi and mycorrhizae. This project will be integrated into BioBook, a multimedia teaching and learning tool which we are developing at WFU.
