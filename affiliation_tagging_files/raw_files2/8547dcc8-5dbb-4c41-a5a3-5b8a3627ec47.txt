Dr Annette Miltenberger
Research Fellow
Email address: A.Miltenberger@leeds.ac.uk
Room: 10.115
Affiliation: Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science
Biography
Annette Miltenberger recently completed her PhD at ETH Zurich with Heini Wernli and Hanna Joos. In her thesis she developed a novel module for the regional numerical weather model COSMO, which allows to calculate trajectories at a very high temporal resolution during the model integration. The Lagrangian perspective was then utilized to better understand the precipitation formation in stable orographic clouds and to investigate the non-dimensional numbers governing their precipitation efficiency. The high temporally resolved trajectories proved additionally very beneficial in case studies of foehn flow over the Swiss Alps, which revisited the question of foehn air warming. Besides Annette was involved in study on cirrus cloud formation in collaboration with Erika Kienast, Luo Beiping and Thomas Peter.
Currently Annette is working as research fellow in the Aerosol and Cloud Group lead by Paul Field at ICAS, where she will investigate the interaction of cloud microphysical and dynamical processes in ice-phase clouds.
