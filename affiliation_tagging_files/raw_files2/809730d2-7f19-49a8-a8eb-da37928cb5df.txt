Dr. Perry Adebar
Bio
Dr. Perry Adebar, P.Eng. is a Professor of Structural Engineering and Head of the Department of Civil Engineering. He is an expert in the design and evaluation of concrete structures, with a particular interest in the seismic design and evaluation of tall concrete buildings. Dr. Adebar is a member and vice-chair of Technical Committee CSA A23.3, which writes the Canadian Standard for the structural design of concrete buildings, and is chair of the sub-committee on seismic design. He is also a member of the Canadian Standing Committee on Earthquake Design (SCED), which writes the seismic design provisions in the National Building Code of Canada, serves on the Board of Directors of the Structural Engineers Association of BC (SEABC), and contributes his structural engineering expertise to the Vancouver’s Heavy Urban Search and Rescue (HUSAR) Team – Canada Task Force 1. As a specialized engineering consultant, Dr. Adebar has been involved in a number of projects to design, evaluate and repair concrete structures. Professor Adebar received the APEGBC Teaching Award for Excellence in Engineering Education in 2015, the UBC Killam Teaching Prize in 2013, the Meritorious Achievement Award from APEGBC in 2004 and the ACI Structural Research Award in 1998.  He served as Associate Dean of the Faculty of Applied Science from 1999 to 2008. Dr. Adebar joined the Department of Civil Engineering in 1990 after completing a Ph.D. in Structural Engineering at the University of Toronto (1990), an M.A.Sc. in Structural Eng. from the University of Toronto (1987), B.Eng. in Civil Eng. from Lakehead University (1984), and a Diploma in Structural Eng. Tech. from Ryerson University (1981).
