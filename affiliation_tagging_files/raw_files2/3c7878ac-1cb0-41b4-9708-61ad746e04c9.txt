RESEARCH INTERESTS
My background is aging, cancer, nutritional and clinical epidemiology. Most of my previous research has been around the influence of vitamin D in the development and prognosis of cancer in older adults. I am very experienced in the analysis of large cohort studies, systematic reviews, traditional and individual participant data meta-analysis.
More recently my focus has been on diagnostic accuracy studies, diagnostic meta-analysis and network meta-analysis. Most of my current research projects have something to do with infectious diseases.
I collaborate at the moment with the Diagnostic Evidence Co-operative and the Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care.
TEACHING
I am involved in the teaching of medical statistics to undergraduate medical students and postgraduate students in the MSc in Evidence-Based Health Care. I am also co coordinator of the MSc module Introduction to Study Design and Research Methods.
