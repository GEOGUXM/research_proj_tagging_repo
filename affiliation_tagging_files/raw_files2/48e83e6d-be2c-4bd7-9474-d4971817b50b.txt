Richard Meek
Senior Teaching Fellow
Profile
Initially employed as an agricultural economist before working in industry on UK, European and world food market analysis. This was followed by a move to export marketing with a specific remit in Italy and Switzerland and then UK and European food industry consultancy. Since 1995 work has included university teaching (initially De Montfort) before working at Lancaster University from 2000.
An industry training role has included a 10 year period as a Chartered Institute of Marketing examiner for national and international professional exams. In addition to my role in the university, roles also include course consultancy for institutions linked with the university. More general consultancy work has been undertaken mainly in marketing knowledge, education and training for Financial Times Knowledge, News International, the Institute for Financial Services as well as several international commercial organisations. A main area of interest is in the application of marketing theory to practice, especially employing high engagement computer simulations and simulated contexts and this is reflected in the courses I teach. For example, a business strategy simulation as a capstone event on the MBA programme. This teaching preference arose from work on an industry commissioned masters by thesis requiring a simulation approach.
Computer simulations in teaching developed into an interest in digital marketing, where I have created an undergraduate module informed by the CEO of a leading, global digital analytics company (comScore). Understanding consumer behaviour in the digital ecosystem is a current research interest. I am also an external examiner for a post graduate masters programme in Digital Marketing.
In addition to digital marketing, understanding 'theory into practice’ in the context of pricing is also an interest, both for research and as the subject of one of my taught post graduate modules.
