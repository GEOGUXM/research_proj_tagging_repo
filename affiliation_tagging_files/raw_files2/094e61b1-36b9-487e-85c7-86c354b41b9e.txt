Biography
Dr. Hanners is an early career physician-scientist. As a pediatric resident, chief resident, pediatric infectious disease fellow, and now as a faculty member, Dr. Hanners developed and pursued her interest in encephalitis. She is interested in the pathophysiology and immune response to viral central nervous system (CNS) infections. Dr. Hannersâ€™ research involves the investigation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) for antiviral effects on neurotropic viruses including Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses. She has also pursued her interest in CNS infections by investigating the effects of Zika virus infection on neural progenitor cells.
Dr. Hanners is currently an Assistant Instructor of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at UT Southwestern. Her research career will focus on elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of Flavivirus CNS infections, as well as the innate immune response to such infections. She will also continue her clinical work in Pediatric Infectious Diseases, and have a particular interest in patients with CNS infections.
