Biographical details
Professor Arthur Conigrave was appointed Dean of Sydney Medical School in 2016. As Dean, he leads one of the largest medical schools in Australia and the most research-intensive faculty within the University of Sydney. Sydney Medical School has more than 3000 academic faculty members and teaches over 5000 students across undergraduate medical sciences, medicine, postgraduate professional courses and higher research degrees. Prior to his appointment as Dean, Professor Conigrave held a number of leadership roles including Head of the School of Molecular Bioscience from 2007-10 and since 2011, Deputy Dean and Associate Dean (Finance and Administration) in Sydney Medical School.

Professor Conigrave is an endocrinologist specialising in the clinical management of patients with metabolic bone disease (including osteoporosis and disorders of calcium metabolism), and an internationally recognised researcher in molecular endocrinology. He has a special interest in the manner in which cells ‘sense’ nutrients in their external environment and the role of nutrient-sensing receptors in the metabolic basis of health and disease. Professor Conigrave’s work has clarified the links between calcium and amino acid metabolism, which has implications for bone health and disease. He is an expert on Calcium Sensing Receptor (CaSR) signaling mechanisms and he accurately predicted that the CaSR mediates L-amino acid-induced release of important gut hormones. Professor Conigrave is past Chair of the NHMRC Grant Review Panel in Musculoskeletal Medicine and a two-time winner of the Lilly Endocrinology Research Awards.

Research interests
Professor Conigrave is interested in the links between nutrient-sensing receptors and the metabolic basis of health and disease with an emphasis on food intake and metabolic bone disease. His laboratory’s work focuses on a subgroup of the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily (‘class C’) that includes amino acid sensors involved in triggering gut digestive and hormonal regulatory responses. Having identified binding sites for the nutrient sensors on GPCR class C, his team is characterising the downstream signaling pathways and resultant biological effects. He also has extensively studied the parathyroid gland and mechanisms of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion control by the CaSR in normal glands and adenomatous disease in primary hyperparathyroidism.
Professor Conigrave pioneered the theory underpinning the recognition of the CaSR as an L-amino acid sensor in the GI tract, thus coupling dietary protein-derived signals to the release of hormones that promote nutrient digestion and absorption and provide satiety signals. He is testing a novel CaSR mutant in a transgenic mouse setting, for defects in protein-dependent control of food intake. He also is investigating the class C GPCRs’ ligand-dependent biased signaling effects including control of gene expression in metabolic pathways.
Additionally, his group has recently demonstrated that a protein of the Homer family plays a critical role in bone cell viability and function. They are investigating the in vitro and in vivo effects of alterations in the amounts of this protein and others of this family, present in bone cells, to determine whether these proteins could be targeted for treatment of osteoporosis and/or bone cancers.
