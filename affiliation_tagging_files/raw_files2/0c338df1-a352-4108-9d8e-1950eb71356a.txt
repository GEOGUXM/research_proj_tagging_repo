Biography:
My research interests are synthetic in nature and includes several areas of biological anthropology including hominoid systematics and evolution, human evolution, human and non-human primate skeletal morphology, and biological and cultural concepts of race. Among my foci is the analysis of interpopulational cranial variation in the orangutan as compared with that present in the African apes. This exploration complements current genetic and behavioral analyses of inter- and intra-island differences as researchers try to understand the complex and often paradoxical patterning of orangutan variability. Such morphometric analyses are also vital to the study of Miocene hominoid evolution, particularly for the comparative analysis and taxonomic assignment of fossil specimens.
