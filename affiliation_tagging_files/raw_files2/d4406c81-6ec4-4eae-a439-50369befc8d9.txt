RELEVANT FUNCIONS
Eric van Berkum was born and raised in Hengelo(O). He holds a BSc and MSc in Applied Mathematics at the University of Twente. After a career as a software engineer at Cap Gemini he moved in 1988 to Goudappel Coffeng, a traffic and transport consultancy in Deventer. He worked there for 21 years in which he has had several positions. His main research interest is on transport modeling, networks, travel behaviour and traffic management. In 1998 he became a parttime professor in traffic management at the Centre for Transport Studies. In 2009 he left Goudappel Coffeng and became a full professor and also head of the Centre for Transport Studies.
