Biography: 
Professor Justin Cooper-White is a biological engineer and Group Leader at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology. His research group, the Tissue Engineering and Microfluidics (TEaM) laboratory, is focused on developing novel solutions for repairing damaged or diseased tissues using regenerative medicine principles and early disease detection using point-of-care devices. The group develops smart surfaces, scaffolds and diagnostic microdevices for a range of regenerative (and personalised) medicine applications. These applications include human stem cell expansion and differentiation; heart, fibrocartilage (intervertebral disc and meniscus) and bone tissue repair; cell-based drug discovery and screening; and early detection of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Professor Cooper-White is also the Associate Dean (Research) for The University of Queensland’s Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Information Technology; and Director of the Australian National Fabrication Facility (Queensland Node).
Research: 
Professor Cooper-White and his research group are focussed on designing and developing complex, polymer-based structures and devices tailored for investigation
and manipulation of biological systems and, in particular, to invoke control over stem cell behaviours and tissue genesis. Projects underway include investigations into engineering surfaces for stem cell attachment and phenotype control; tailored polymeric scaffolds for drug delivery, cell delivery and stem cell based tissue engineering; cell-based diagnostic microdevices for mapping cellular microenvironments and drug discovery and screening; and microfluidic devices for manufacturing functional microparticles and early disease detection.
