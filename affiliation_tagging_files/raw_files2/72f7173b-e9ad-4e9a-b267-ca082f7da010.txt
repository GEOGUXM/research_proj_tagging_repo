Awards:
Recognition for being an inspiration (23 November 2013)  by a Mathematics Method 3 student
The photo frame that was handed to me contained an article and my photograph that appeared in the newspaper Izindaba and had the following words typed in: Dr V Mudaly You are not only my lecturer or teacher, you are my friend, mentor and guide, all rolled into one person. I will always be grateful for your support and kindness. May God keep and bless you as you continue to inspire more students. Thank you.
