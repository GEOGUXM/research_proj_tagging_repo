Andrew Wilde hails form the UK and moved to North America for Post-Doctoral work with Frances Brodsky at UCSF where he discovered novel links between receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and endocytosis. Subsequently, he moved to the Carnegie Institution in Baltimore to work with Yixian Zheng where he discovered a chromosome based signaling pathway that spatially organizes a mitotic cell. Andrew moved to Toronto in 2001 where he held a Canada Research Chair in Cell Biology. Andrew has continued his work examining how signals spatially co-ordinate mitosis with a particular focus on the co-ordination of chromosome segregation with membrane re-organization during cytokinesis and the role of tumor suppressors in regulating this process to ensure genome stability.
RESEARCH LAB
In the Wilde lab we study the molecular processes that drive cell division and the maintenance of genome stability. Using a combination of biochemical and imaging techniques, we exploit a variety of model systems, frogs, flies and tissue culture cells, to address different molecular questions related to cell division.

RESEARCH DESCRIPTION
Cell Division in Tumor Formation and Oogenesis
Our research focus is to understand how cells divide. In particular we focus on the role of cell division in tumor formation and oogenesis. We take a multi-faceted approach combining biochemistry and live imaging to analyze cell division in frog eggs, Drosophila embryos and mammalian cells.
