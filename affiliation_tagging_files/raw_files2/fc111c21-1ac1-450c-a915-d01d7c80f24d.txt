Biographical details
Dr Adams’ work and teaching focus on the United States broadly construed with emphases on political economy as well as the recent history of New Orleans and the Gulf South. He is completing a book entitled The Servicing of America: Work, Value, and Inequality in the Modern U.S.. This project argues that the hidden history of contemporary American economic inequality lies in the political and cultural history of the devaluation of specific kinds of human labor that was seen as antithetical to republican notion of citizenship and masculinity. Another book, a collection of essays edited with Steve Striffler, Working in the Big Easy: Labor in New Orleans from Slavery to Post-Katrina will be published in 2014 and is the first comprehensive labor history of New Orleans.
