BIOGRAPHY
Luisa Caldas is Professor of Architecture at UC Berkeley. An architect by training, she has been active for more than twenty years in the field of sustainable design and green building, both in academia and as an energy consultant for large commercial buildings. Her work focuses on the use of advanced computational tools for early stage deployment of environmental factors into the design process. A main area of research is the integration of challenging, complex geometry architectural solutions with sustainability dimensions, by developing the conceptual processes, workflows, and computational tools that allow multiple scale integration, from master planning to building design to envelope components.

Caldas research applies advanced energy simulation tools in the context of generative design environments. She is the author of GENE_ARCH, the first generative design system that integrated Energy Plus as its simulation engine, and used Pareto Genetic Algorithms for search and generation of energy efficient buildings by simultaneously optimizing thermal and lighting energy patterns. GENE_ARCH currently integrates other simulation engines, such as Radiance, Daysim and Evalglare.

Recent software development includes Painting with Light, a user-guided interactive evolutionary system for daylighting design, that allows architects to use color to specify desired light levels in space, and searches for solutions that bring building geometry close to those performance targets, and Sun_Carve, for direct light design. Luisa Caldas is also a member of the Center for Augmented Cognition at UC Berkeley (http://augcog.berkeley.edu/).
Professor Caldas is the director of the newly founded VR/AR Lab in Architecture and is currently offering several courses in VR applications to architecture design. 
  Examples of student course work:
