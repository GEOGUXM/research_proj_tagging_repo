Academic Degree
Ph.D.
Field of Specialization
Psychology of Hearing
Outline Activities
The current research themes are the following: (1) multivariate analyses of speech, (2) perception of noise-vocoded speech, (3) auditory short-term memory. The third theme is a collaboration work with Technische Universitaet Darmstadt, Germany. He had been a member of the Perceptual Psychology Unit of the governmental "Center of Excellence" (COE) program entitled "Design of Artificial Environments on the Basis of Human Sensibility," Kyushu University, since 2003. He joined a membership of "Center for Applied Perceptual Research," since its foundation in 2010. The Center developed into "Research Center for Applied Perceptual Science" in 2013.

He supervises some undergraduate and graduate students. He teaches Psychology of Hearing, Auditory Perception and Cognition, Perceptual Psychology, Science of Auditory and Visual Perception, etc. He had taught Psychology, Perceptual Psychology, Experimental Design, etc. at Kyoto Prefectural University.

He has experienced managements in publishing and research meetings at the Acoustical Society of Japan and at the Japanese Society for Music Perception and Cognition.

Current and Past Project
Perception of locally time-reversed speech is investigated. A paper has been published (Ueda et al., 2017).
A series of experiments is planned to use results from Ueda & Naka jima (2008) in order to produce speech which is degraded in systematical ways. Speciﬁcally, noise-vocoded speech shall be produced that lacks the spectral ﬁne-structure of the original recording, and that permits to systematically vary the number of frequency channels used in the synthesis. Furthermore, conventional critical-band based synthesis methods shall be compared with ones that partition the audible frequency range into ’meaningful’ units as determined by Ueda, Naka jima & Araki (2009). Finally, input signals other than noise may be used for the vocoder. The stimuli thus generated may serve as interfering background in ’irrelvant speech’ type paradigms as studied by Ellermeier & Zimmer (1997) or Zimmer, Ghani & Ellermeier (2008). The results may elucidate what makes sounds ’speech-like’ and what are the acoustical properties that produce the greatest degree of memory impairment in the irrelevant sound paradigm. Simultaneously they serve to validate the concept of speech-based auditory universals proposed by Ueda et al. (2009). Several aural presentations and poster presentations were conducted (e.g., Ueda, Nakajima, Doumoto, Ellemeier, and Kattner, 2011; Ellemeier, Kattner, Ueda, Nakajima, and Doumoto, 2012). The first output of our collaboration in a referee journal was published in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America ( Ellermeier, Kattner, Ueda, Doumoto, and Nakajima, 2015).
