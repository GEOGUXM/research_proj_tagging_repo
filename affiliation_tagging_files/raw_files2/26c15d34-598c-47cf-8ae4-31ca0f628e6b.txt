Researcher biography
I have an extensive midwifery and public health background, having worked internationally and in Australia. Clinically, my experience includes managing and providing health care to Indigenous Populations in remote communities alongside local healthcare workers. Additionally I have participated in a team caring for children and adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes and has proficiency in acute birthing care in a major tertiary referral centre. I am now embarking on an early research career and have recently completed my PhD in comparing maternity paper and electronic health records and the impact these records have on integrating care between pregnant women and antenatal health care providers. I have commenced a lecturing position with the School of Nursing, Midwifery and Social Work at the University of Queensland. My major themes of research are in antenatal, birthing, indigenous and e-information systems in order to improve communication and access to quality health care.
