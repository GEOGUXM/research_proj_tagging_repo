Hadrien Montanelli
PhD Appl. Math., MSc. Appl. Math., MSc. Aero. Eng.
Postgraduate Student
I have just finished my PhD in Numerical Analysis at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of Prof. Nick Trefethen and fully funded by the European Research Council. 
My PhD involved numerical algorithms for differential equations with periodicity, and led to the publication of several research articles in leading journals and presentations at conferences and seminars in Beijing, Rio de Janeiro, Paris, Lausanne, Glasgow, Nottingham and Oxford.
Next year, I will be working with Prof. Qiang Du at Columbia.

Research Interests: 
My general research interests lie in nonlinear differential equations, and in particular my work so far has concerned the numerical computation of periodic solutions.

1. Trigonometric Approximation Theory and Algorithms. I am working on fast algorithms for numerical computation with periodic functions via approximations to machine precision by trigonometric polynomials, including the solution of linear and nonlinear periodic ODEs. These algorithms are at the heart of the recent extension of Chebfun to periodic problems [5].
2. Stiff PDEs with periodicity.  I am interested in the computation of solutions of periodic stiff PDEs in 1D, 2D, 3D and on the sphere to high accuracy.
For periodic problems in 1D/2D/3D, I have compared 30 exponential integrators, focusing on fourth and higher order methods and periodic problems, and showed that is it hard to beat one of the simplest of these formulas, the ETDRK4 scheme of Cox and Matthews [2].
On the sphere, I have revisited the double Fourier sphere method, made minor corrections to previous work, and compared different time-stepping schemes from a theoretical and practical viewpoint, to find that implicit-explicit schemes outperform exponential integrators [1]. The manuscript also contains theoretical contributions, most notably the realness of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix.
3. Choreographies. I have investigated the computation of choreographies, periodic solutions (in time) of the n-body problem, in which the bodies share a common orbit. Recently, I found new choreographies on the Poincaré disk [3] and on the sphere [4] using stereographic projection, trigonometric interpolation, and quasi-Newton and Newton optimization methods. 
I believe that the techniques I have used for finding these solutions can be applied not only to particle dynamics but also to other types of dynamics. A possible extension of this work would therefore be the study of choreographies of the n-vortex problem, which describes the motion of n vortices, complex potentials associated with the two-dimensional, irrotational and incompressible Euler equations.
