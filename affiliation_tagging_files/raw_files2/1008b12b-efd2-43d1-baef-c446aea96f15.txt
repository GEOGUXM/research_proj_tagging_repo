Profile
I'm a tenured academic in the Department of Biological Science at Macquarie University (2009 - ). My undergrad degree was in botany at the University of Melbourne (B.Sc Hons 1995). I was awarded a PhD in plant ecology by Macquarie University in 2002. After that I held various positions including ARC Discovery Postdoctoral Fellow (2005-8), Deputy Convenor of the ARC-NZ Research Network for Vegetation Function (2005-9), and ARC Future Fellow (2011-2015). Currently I am Deputy-Associate Dean of Research for the Faculty of Science & Engineering.
I convene BIOL347 Plants and Ecosystems.
I lead the committee over-seeing the Macquarie University Plant Growth Facility.
Research interests
Understanding plant ecological strategies via functional traits
Quantifying trait relationships from local to global scales (and the effects of climate and soils)
Understanding the anatomical, physiological & evolutionary underpinnings of trait variation
Developing and testing 'first principles' theory for plant function, for use in vegetation modelling
Biogeographic patterns in the Australian flora
Using 'omic technologies to ask ecological questions
New approaches to predicting and monitoring outbreaks of Myrtle Rust (Puccinia psidii)
