Graduate Program

Graduate Students | Recent/Past Graduates

  Tulane University's City, Culture, and Community (CCC) is an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program, created with a co-operation of the Department of Sociology, the School of Social Work, and Urban Studies, along with participating faculty located in the School of Liberal Arts, the School of Architecture, School of Law, School of Public Health, and the School of Science and Engineering.

The intellectual focus of the CCC Ph.D. Program is unique in bringing together interdisciplinary approaches in the social and natural sciences, social work, architecture, law, humanities and applying them to understand a range of issues pertaining to cities, culture, and communities.

As a broad-based and integrative graduate education-research program, the CCC addresses interrelationships between the physical environment, the built environment, and social, economic, and political institutions and processes that shape urban areas.

The CCC Ph.D. Program's breadth of interdisciplinary study allows students considerable flexibility to develop their training to individual research interests while providing a depth of disciplinary training for those students who wish to pursue training in social work or sociology.

By interconnecting interdisciplinary and disciplinary education and training, the CCC program faculty encourage graduate students to select dissertation topics that offer the potential for a cross-disciplinary approach with the Ph.D. degree awarded in "Social Work–City, Culture, and Community," "Sociology–City, Culture, and Community," or "Urban Studies-City, Culture, and Community."

The goal is to produce a well-trained cadre of professionals, social scientists, and humanists who have a common vocabulary, and an integrated framework, with practical and creative experiences to pursue careers in wide range of sectors: academic, governmental, community, private, and public, or some combination.
