Valerie Manusov (PhD, University of Southern California, 1989), Professor, has served as Chair for the Interpersonal and Nonverbal Communication Divisions of the National Communication Association and for the Interpersonal Communication Interest Group of the Western States Communication Association. Professor Manusov teaches courses in Interpersonal and Nonverbal Communication at the graduate and undergraduate level and leads the departmental honors program. She is the co-editor of The Sage Handbook of Nonverbal Communication, and the editor or co-editor of two other volumes. Her recent research focuses primarily on the ways in which nonverbal events are interpreted and how such discourse represents particular views about the nature of nonverbal communication, cultural values, relational quality, and other attributes. Currently, she is working on a research team investigating how mindfulness plays out in interpersonal relationships and serves on UW’s Graduate Council.
