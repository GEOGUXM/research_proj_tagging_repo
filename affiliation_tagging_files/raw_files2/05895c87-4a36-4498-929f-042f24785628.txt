  Research
Pedro's PhD research aims to offer a conceptual explanation for the selection of the indicative and the subjunctive in European Portuguese subordination contexts. Cognitive Linguistics in general and, more precisely, Cognitive Grammar in particular, provides the theoretical background that allowed Pedro to identify the conceptual motivations for selecting each mood. In a nutshell, he is revisiting the traditional Kiparsky and Kiparsky's notion of factivity and submitting it to a conceptual approach, where it is addressed as a gradable category that can be construed in terms of emphasis and attenuation. His claim is that the choice of mood is related to this conceptual manipulation of the subordinated event's factivity: the indicative is selected to emphasise an event's factivity whereas the subjunctive is selected in contexts where that factivity is to be attenuated.
