Research Activities: 
A) Studies on the regulation and functions of tyrosine kinases, with particular emphasis on the human c-src gene product cSrc.   cSrc is a master cellular control protein that is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, motility, angiogenesis and other functions. When its kinase activity is aberrantly activated, cSrc is capable of causing the development and/or progression of various cancers, such as colon and breast cancer.   We have recently shown that an important function of Src involves the targeting and phosphorylation of important tumor suppressor proteins such as pVHL (von Hippel-Lindau),  and ING1b (with K. Riabowol’s lab),  resulting in their destabilization and functional impairment.
 
B) Development and use of strategies to inhibit tumor growth and metastases utilizing RNA interference (RNAi) with specific siRNAs or combinations of siRNAs that knock-down levels of important cancer causing proteins.  Currently, tumor penetrating peptides (TPPs) and TPP-nanoparticle delivery systems are being designed and evaluated for their ability to block breast cancer tumor growth and metastasis in mouse model systems.
