Current Research Projects
Dr Cheever is Member and Director of Solid Tumor Research for the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) and Professor of Medicine and Associate Director of Medical Oncology for the University of Washington (UW). Dr. Cheever sees his mandate to help facilitate Solid Tumor Research as both exciting and challenging. The development and testing of new therapies to treat the common cancers is a pressing national and global need. Our team at the FHCRC and UW is increasingly expert and accomplished in evaluating and developing the promise of new cancer therapies beginning with preclinical work, early stage clinical trials and pivotal trials. The efforts of the group are contributing substantially to hasten the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry’s development of cancer drugs and therapy regimens. There’s enormous potential here.
His own research expertise is in cancer immune therapy and cancer vaccine development. From 1987 to 1997 he served a Professor of Medicine UW and Member FHCRC with a major focus on developing the principles of T cell therapy, cancer antigen discovery and development of cancer vaccines, especially for breast cancer. In 1994, he co-founded a biotech company, Corixa Corporation, in order to develop cancer vaccines as therapeutic products. He served as Vice President of Clinical Research and Medical Affairs from 1997 to 2005. In this capacity, he gained extensive experience with: design and initiation of cancer vaccine trials; cancer antigen discovery and cancer vaccine development in collaboration with major pharmaceutical corporations as well as FDA related product approval issues.
He has recently consulted extensively with the NCI to help prioritize
immunotherapy agents with the highest potential for cancer therapy,
cancer vaccine target antigens and
multi-component cancer vaccine regimens.
He is working with the NCI towards development of a collaborative immunotherapy trials network.
Training
Dr. Cheever received his MD from the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan. He completed his internship and residency at the University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington. He was a Senior Fellow and Instructor in Medicine, Division of Oncology at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.
