Research Interests
Research in chemical crystallography is broadly based and a variety of problems in both inorganic and organic chemistry are presently under investigation.Currently there are four staff members and ten postgraduate students working in crystallography and supramolecular chemistry. We are very well equipped with a variety of single crystal goniometers, modern diffractometers and good computing facilities.The main thrust of the research is in the field of inclusion compounds. We are investigating the structure and thermal stability of a variety of host-guest compounds. Molecular inclusion chemistry has become an important technique for the separation of close structural isomers and for the optical resolution of chiral compounds.Host:guest ratios are established by a variety of techniques, including thermal gravimetry, NMR and density measurements, while the strength of host–guest interaction is measured by differential thermal calorimetry. Thermal measurements are correlated with structural results obtained by X-ray diffraction and molecular mechanics calculations.
We collaborate with a number of other research groups both at UCT and at other centres in South Africa. We also enjoy close ties with various groups overseas: Dr F. Allen (Cambridge), Prof A. Gavezzotti (Milan), Prof J. Lipkowski (Warsaw), Prof G. M. Sheldrick (Gottingen), Prof F. Toda (Ehime, Japan), Prof E. Weber (Freiberg) and Prof G. Desiraju (Hyderabad, India).
