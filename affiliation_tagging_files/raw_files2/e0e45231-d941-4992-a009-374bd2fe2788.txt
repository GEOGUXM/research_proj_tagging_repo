Arnold M. Eisen, one of the world's foremost authorities on American Judaism, is the seventh chancellor of The Jewish Theological Seminary. Since taking office in 2007, Chancellor Eisen has transformed the education of religious, pedagogical, professional, and lay leaders for North American Jewry, with a focus on graduating highly skilled, innovative leaders who bring Judaism alive in ways that speak authentically to Jews at a time of rapid and far-reaching change.
In 2015, Chancellor Eisen announced that JTS would undertake a major project to re-imagine its Morningside Heights campus, aligning it with JTS’s mission to be a center of inquiry, conversation, and inspiration for the Jewish community of North America. The 21st Century Campus Project, now underway, will create a physical space designed to foster innovation, learning, and collaboration, and to strengthening JTS as a hub of focused inquiry and high-level discussion about the transformation of our tradition and our community.
During his tenure, Chancellor Eisen has placed significant emphasis on strengthening Jewish learning in our communities, creating programs that extend the reach of JTS’s scholarship and resources beyond the campus to Jewish learners around the world. These programs include expanded access to the treasures of The JTS Library through increased digitization, a new JTS Fellows program to increase opportunities for adult learning, and the development of JTS Torah Online, a rich menu of videos, podcasts, and Torah commentary.
Chancellor Eisen’s initiatives also include the new Block / Kolker Center for Spiritual Arts; programs to strengthen early childhood, experiential, adult, and Israel education; the Arts Initiative; the interfaith Center for Pastoral Education; and the Milstein Center for Interreligious Dialogue.
Before coming to JTS, Chancellor Eisen served on the faculties of Stanford, Tel Aviv, and Columbia universities. An award-winning writer and advocate for the Jewish community, the chancellor's many publications include Rethinking Modern Judaism, and most recently, Conservative Judaism Today and Tomorrow, a collection of personal and passionate essays that explore essential matters of Jewish belief and practice from a Conservative perspective.
He contributes regularly to print and online media, including the Wall Street Journal, The Jewish Week, Huffington Post, Tablet, and Fortune, and he discusses Jewish education, philosophy, and values on his blog, On My Mind: Arnie Eisen. He is a lifelong and devoted Conservative Jew.
