 Profile
Xiuping Jiang is a Professor in Food Microbiology at the Department of Food, Nutrition, and Packaging Sciences, and a joint appointment with Department of Biological Sciences, Clemson University. She earned her Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Food Science/Food Microbiology from the Ocean University of China, her Ph.D. in Food Microbiology from the University of Maryland, and her postdoctoral training at the Center for Food Safety, the University of Georgia.

Dr. Jiang is interested in understanding how the foodborne pathogens persist in food and pre-harvest environment, and developing the strategies to detect and control these pathogens. Her current research explores the effect of environmental factors on pathogen inactivation during composting, validates pathogen inactivation for thermally treated chicken litter, evaluates the role of compost or other organic fertilizers in the microbiological safety of fresh produce production, develops bacteriophage-based biological approaches to eradicate Salmonella biofilms, and detects and disinfects human norovirus on environmental surfaces.

Dr. Jiang has published more than 90 peer-reviewed scientific articles. She served as South Carolina branch President for both International Association for Food Protection (IAFP) and American Society for Microbiology (ASM), and a president-elect for Chinese Association for Food Protection in North America (CAFPNA).
 Research Interests
I am interested in understanding how the foodborne pathogens persist in food and pre-harvest environment, and developing the strategies to detect and control these pathogens. My current research explores the effect of environmental factors on pathogen inactivation during composting, validates pathogen inactivation for thermally treated chicken litter, evaluates the role of compost or other organic fertilizers in the microbiological safety of fresh produce production, develops bacteriophage-based biological approaches to eradicate Salmonella biofilms, detects and disinfects human norovirus on environmental surfaces.
