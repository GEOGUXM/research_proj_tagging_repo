PROFILE
Dr. Poitras Pratt is of Métis ancestry with family in the Fishing Lake Métis Settlement AB. She graduated from high school in BC. Yvonne moved to Calgary, married and worked downtown for several years. She returned to school in 1996 as a mature student with children and graduated with honours from Canadian (Native) Studies, with a minor in Education. She earned her MA (2005) and PhD (2011) and worked as Associate Director, Métis Education at Rupertsland Institute. In 2013, Yvonne joined the Faculty of Education at the University of Calgary where she teaches courses in Indigenous Education and adult education.
RESEARCH & SCHOLARLY ACTIVITY
Dr. Pratt’s research focuses on the use of new media, particularly digital storytelling, as a means to revitalize cultural traditions and intergenerational learning within Métis communities. One community has now created 19 digital stories about their lives as contemporary Métis. Yvonne has also brought digital storytelling into an urban setting through a partnership between Rupertsland Institute and the Council of Elders at the Edmonton Catholic School District. Related to this work is Dr. Pratt’s investigation into the relationship between technology and traditional storytelling and how technology can be used to reclaim voice and traditional ways of knowing through multiple literacies.
Current Projects:
Meaningful Media: An Ethnography of a Digital Strategy Within a Métis Community, funded in part by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council under a Canada Graduate Scholarship (2005) and through Fishing Lake Métis Settlement
Digital Storytelling project with Council of Elders and FNMI youth (March 2013), sponsored by Rupertsland Institute and Edmonton Catholic School District Council of Elders
