The Centre for Foreign Language Study
The Centre for Foreign Language Study (CFLS) delivers language training to 2,000 language learners, including students and researchers at the University, as well as to University staff, those who use second languages at work, and the general public. It is our philosophy to encourage language learning as widely as possible, and for a variety of purposes. Anyone who wishes to learn a language, for whatever reason, should be able to do so. We currently offer courses in 14 different languages.
We aim to deliver a broad portfolio of language courses, and work collaboratively with other language centres in UK universities, and are a member of the Association of University Language Centres of the UK & Ireland (AULC).
Navigate through our menu links to find a language and a course which is right for you.
Our 17-18 programme will be available soon.
