About
Nicholas Vargas is Assistant Professor in the Center for Latin American Studies and in the Department of Sociology, Criminology & Law. He is also the Latina/o Studies specialization coordinator for the Masters in Latin American Studies (MALAS) program. Vargas received a B.A. in Sociology and Criminal Justice from Bloomsburg University, M.A. in Sociology from the University of Florida, and Ph.D. in Sociology from Purdue University. Before coming to UF, Vargas was Assistant Professor at The University of Texas at Dallas. His research examines how socially constructed categories of race and religion are 1) measured in social science research, 2) shape social networks, and 3) act as sources of stratification, especially in higher education among U.S. Latina/os. He is currently studying the racialization of higher education with a particular focus on Hispanic Serving Institutions. Vargas is also researching issues related to racial contestation, the experience whereby one’s personal racial identity does not match how they are perceived racially by others.
