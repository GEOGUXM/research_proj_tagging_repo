Biography:
Currently, I am Associate Professor of History and Asian Studies and have served as the Department of History's Director of Graduate Studies since the Fall of 2010.  I received my PhD from University of Hawai'i Manoa studying under Dr. Dru C. Gladney.
My early research largely centered on the ethno-religious identity of the Muslim Chinese (or Hui) in the southwestern Chinese province of Yunnan. I have published several articles on this topic and a monograph entitled The Chinese Sultanate: Islam, Ethnicity and the Panthay Rebellion in Southwestern China, 1856-1873 was published by Stanford University Press (2006). More recently, I have been dividing my time between two distinct projects the first on a re-examination of Qing China's 'corridors of contact' as seen through the eyes of Lin Zexu and a broad study of the Tibetan Muslims. A firm believer that a strong teacher makes a strong scholar, I co-authored with Yurong Yang Atwill, Sources in Chinese History: Diverse Perspectives from 1644 to the Present, which was published with Prentice Hall in March 2009.
