PHILIP WOOD'S RESEARCH FOCUS
RELATED DISEASES > METABOLIC DISEASES, OBESITY, TYPE 2 DIABETES
The Wood lab has been interested in genotype/phenotype relationships relevant to metabolic diseases, especially those involving fatty acid metabolism. We were interested in what alleles (versions) of genes that be a primary cause of diseases, such as rare inherited enzyme deficiencies affecting children to versions of genes that predispose or even protect individuals from the problems often associated with excess fat presented to the body in obese states. 

Using six mouse models and now human patients with rare inherited enzyme deficiencies of the fat burning pathway, our research was focused on two major areas:
Inherited enzyme deficiencies in the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation pathway.
Obesity-related disease traits that include fatty liver, pro-inflammatory state, insulin resistance and the many traits associated with metabolic syndrome.
