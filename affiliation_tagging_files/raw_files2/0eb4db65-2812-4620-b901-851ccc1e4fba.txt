Biographical Sketch
Dr. Hippler obtained his Dipl. Phys. (diploma degree in Physics) from the Technical University of Karlsruhe, Germany in 1989. Subsequently, after his PhD in Chemistry from Heriot-Watt University in 1993, he became Postdoctoral research assistant and head teaching assistant at the Laboratorium für Physikalische Chemie of the ETH Zürich in Switzerland. In 2001 he did his "Habilitation" and "venia legendi" in Physical Chemistry at the ETH Zürich, after which he became a Lecturer in Physical Chemistry (Privatdozent) at the same institution. In 2005 he was appointed as a Senior Lecturer at the University of Sheffield.
