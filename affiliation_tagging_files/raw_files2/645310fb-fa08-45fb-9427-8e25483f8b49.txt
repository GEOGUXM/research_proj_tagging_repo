Biography
I. Cevdet Noyan has been studying the mechanical response of crystalline materials over various length scales using diffraction since 1978. He was one of the first researchers to combine the theory of micromechanics with that of x-ray and neutron diffraction. He and his group develop x-ray and neutron characterization techniques for non-destructive analysis of structures, with applications spanning suspension bridge cables, integrated circuits, and nanostructures. Prof. Noyan and his co-workers also work on the theory of scattering, with particular emphasis on defining the information volumes from which diffraction data are measured, and quantification of the uncertainties associated with such data.
Noyan received his Ph.D. in Materials Science & Engineering from Northwestern University in 1984. His early research work was at IBM, where he received two IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Awards for research and development of computer and packaging structures, an IBM Research Division Award for research on diffusion barriers, and 11 IBM Invention Plateaus for filed patents. He is also coauthor of the monograph, Residual Stress: Measurement by Diffraction and Interpretation (Materials Research and Engineering).
Prof. Noyan is a member of the organizing committee of the Denver X-ray Conference and co-editor of the Advances in X-Ray Analysis. He is a fellow of the American Physical Society, received the Blackall Machine Tool and Gage Award from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 2006, and received the International Centre for Diffraction Data’s 2015 Jenkins Lifetime Achievement Award, the most prestigious honor for scientists who advance the use of x-rays in materials analysis.
