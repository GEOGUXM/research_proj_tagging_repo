Research Overview
Kang Laboratory, Summer 2016
The Kang Laboratory focuses on the genetics of muscular dystrophy, and the core project involves gene discovery in limb girdle muscular dystrophy and other muscle diseases.  The laboratory makes use of exome and genome sequencing technologies, supplemented as needed by linkage analyses and other approaches.  Dr. Kang and his collaborators enroll research subjects with undiagnosed muscle diseases for these studies.
Genes identified in the core project are considered for more in-depth studies to understand the disease processes better and to seek potential therapeutic targets.  One such gene is MEGF10, which causes a congenital muscle disease with prominent respiratory distress and scoliosis.  The laboratory described a family affected by mutations in this gene, and has determined that at least some pathogenic mutations affect tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein product.  This gene is expressed in muscle satellite cells, suggesting that manipulations of it or its protein product may have therapeutic implications for muscle disease. Further analyses are ongoing.
