Yolanda Tseng, M.D.
Assistant Professor



Overview
A recent graduate of Harvard University Medical School and their radiation oncology residency program, Dr. Tseng believes that cancer is best treated with a team approach that includes other physicians, nurses, and technical staff involved in treatment planning. She has conducted research in diverse areas, including how physicians estimate patient prognosis and its effects on treatment decisions, and how tumor biological subtypes affect patient outcomes and the response to local therapy. She is interested in systematically evaluating how proton radiotherapy can be used to optimize patient care. “As treatment efficacy improves for many disease sites, the goal now is to minimize the long-term side effects of our treatments. My hope is that we can achieve this for our patients.”
Patient Care Philosophy
One of the most anxious times during a cancer diagnosis is determining the plan of action. This requires a team approach, in which both patient and physician learn from each other about their priorities, goals, and expectations. It is important for my patients to feel well informed about their treatment options, since this allows us to make the best decision together about their care.
