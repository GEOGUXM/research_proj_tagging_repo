As an organizational and economic sociologist with a focus on gender inequality, I am particularly interested in understanding organizational mechanisms through which gender inequality is produced and maintained. I attend to both the intra- and inter-organizational processes; I investigate the impact of organizational practices on women’s employment opportunities, as well as the ways in which gender inequality is shaped in different labor market institutions. My current research projects analyze longitudinal data for large Japanese companies and investigate 1) corporate responses to legal pressures to promote gender equality, 2) managers’ implementation of work-family policies, and 3) Japanese firms’ adoption and implementation of global corporate social responsibility (CSR) standards and their impacts.
