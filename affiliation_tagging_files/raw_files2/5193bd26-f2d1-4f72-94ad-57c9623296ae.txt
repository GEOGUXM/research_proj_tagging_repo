Research Interests
Theory of statistical inference under order restrictions
keyword : order restrictions,　statistical inference,　hypothesis testing,　statistical estimation, multivariate normal distribution
1990.04Main research theme is the statistical inference under order restrictions. At present I am studying testing homogenety of several multivariate normal mean vectors under an order restriction. The goals of the research are deriving useful method and examining its properties..
