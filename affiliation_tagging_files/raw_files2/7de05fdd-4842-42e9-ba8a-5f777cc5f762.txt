Curriculum Vitae (PDF)
My reaserch program is currently centered on the development, refinement and extension of spatial, interregional policy modeling of the US, Canadian, EU and world dairy sectors.

I have no extension appointment, but hopefully my research efforts contribute the the AAE extension/outreach in the dairy marketing/policy arena.

I have made numerous presentations to dairy farmeres, processors, policy makers and other professional concerning my dairy marketing and trade research. Prominent among these groups are the Wisconsin Professional Dairy Producers, DATCP, Minnesota and Wisconsin Federation of Cooperatives, and the International Dairy Foods Association.
