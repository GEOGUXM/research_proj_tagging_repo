Families Served: Since opening in 1985, the Ann Arbor House has welcomed about 600 families each year. Their length of stay may range from a day or two to several months. These families generally live at least an hour from Ann Arbor, and many have come from out of state and even from other countries. The capacity of the Ann Arbor House is 29 families, and each is afforded a comfortable sleeping room and access to the kitchen and pantry where they may prepare meals. Each family completes a daily chore to assist with the upkeep of the House.
The Mott House, located on the 10th floor of C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, opened in December 2011. Its capacity is 12 families, and each family has a private sleeping room, shower, and access to snacks and laundry facilities.
Volunteers: Nearly 100 volunteers are involved with the Houses. Many serve on shifts which staff the Houses in three-hour increments, 12 hours per day, 365 days per year. Others are members of committees which manage such aspects of the Houses as their daily operations, fundraising, public relations, and maintenance. As a result, the Houses are able to operate with a small staff.
Finances: The main building, valued at more than $2.2 million and including more than 23,000 square feet, is fully paid for. Less than 15% of the revenue for the operating budget is provided by room donations ($10.00 per night per family) paid by families and by third parties. The remaining revenue comes through donations and special events which the charity sponsors.
Status: The Ronald McDonald House Charities of Ann Arbor is incorporated in Michigan as a non-profit organization. Donations to the House are tax deductible as allowed by law. While licensed by the McDonald's Corporation, the Ronald McDonald House is independently governed by its local Board of Directors. McDonald's provided generous capital support when the House was built and at the time of its expansion, and is the source of about five percent of annual operating funds through Ronald McDonald House Charities and from area McDonald's owner-operators.
