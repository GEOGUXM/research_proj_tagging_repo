Research
Alexandra Aiken is a Senior Research Officer in the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC), Faculty of Medicine, UNSW. She is currently working on a large scale longitudinal study, the Drinking and Teens project. She also coordinates the NSW arm of the Young Australians Alcohol Reporting System (YAARS).
The Drinking and Teens project aims to determine if parental supply of alcohol in the Australian context, affects the progression to harmful levels of drinking in adolescence. This study will research the consequences of parental supply within the broader context of parent, child and peer relationships. It will help to determine how parental supply influences the different patterns of adolescent alcohol consumption over time, providing essential information to help parents prevent alcohol misuse in their children.
The YAARS study aims to detect and predict emergent trends in risky alcohol use among heavy drinkers aged 16-19. The study aims to identify the nature of the alcohol use, related harms, contexts of use, and other influences such as alcohol promotions. The information from this project will be used to make recommendations on how to make things safer for young people.
