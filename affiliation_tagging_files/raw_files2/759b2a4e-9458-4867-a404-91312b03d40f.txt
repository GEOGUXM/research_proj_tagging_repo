Creative Works
1. I am a director of "No Pain Labor and Delivery - Global Health Initiatives (NPLD_GHI)", a SOAP (Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology) outreach program. This is an annual week-long educational program includes one-on-one bedside instruction, daily debriefing sessions discussing daily goals and objectives, crash cesarean delivery simulation drills, and a weekend conference along with a patient education course at each site.

NPLD-GHI was launched in China in 2008 to assist local hospitals in the establishment of self-sustaining obstetric anesthesia systems that will allow them to provide safe and effective neuraxial analgesia (NA). It also aimed to provide annual multidisciplinary visits with continual follow-up to increase collaboration among anesthesiologists, obstetricians, nurses/midwives, and neonatologists. A total of 11 bilingual documents of protocols, responsibilities, and medical records were created, and a web-based translational medical-educational-management informatics system called Baby-on-Board was designed. Additionally, four textbooks and two patient education books were written or translated and published in Chinese.

2. I developed a research curriculum for CRNA program at University of Akron in 2001 and several CRNAs completed their research requirements with me.

I worked with other research faculty in our department to develop the curriculum of research week for CA-1 residents.

I am in the process to create a curriculum for International Medicine rotation for anesthesia residents.

Biographical
I joined The Ohio State University College of Medicine (OSUCOM) in 1988 as a Research Associate. After receiving my Master of Science in 1991 and Doctor of Philosophy in 1993 at OSUCOM, I continued my Post-Doctoral training in the area of neuroscience for three years. Then, in 1996, I returned to clinical medicine and completed my anesthesiology residency training at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). Since 2000, I joined the Department of Anesthesiology at The Ohio State University as an Assistant Professor and I was promoted to the rank of Associate Professor in 2005.

With support from my department, I have fulfilled my responsibilities effectively in the areas of clinical patient care, teaching, administration, and scientific research. I have enjoyed research grants and awards, at various levels, from National Institute of Health to OSUWMC. Both my clinical and basic science research focused primarily on the effects of anesthetics on gastrointestinal function. The results of my research have been published in many peer-reviewed scientific journals. Additionally, I have been invited to give presentations at many national and international conferences, including the American Gastrointestinal Association (AGA), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), Society of Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP), Chinese Society of Anesthesiology (CSA), International Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, The American Society of Critical Care Anesthesiologists (ASCCA), and the Chinese Association of Anesthesiologists (CAA). I have also been invited to give seminars and lectures at many prestigious universities and medical institutes, such as the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, Harbor-UCLA in Los Angeles, California, and Peking Union Medical College in Beijing, China.

The most significant contribution I have made is to lead a SOAP out-reach program called No Pain Labor and Delivery – Global Health Initiative (NPLD-GHI) as a director. China has the highest Cesarean delivery rate in the world with less than 1% of parturients receiving neuraxial analgesia (NA) for labor. The most important role of NA is to reduce maternal/fetal morbidity and mortality. The goal of the NPLD-GHI cooperative program is to promote maternal and fetal safety during the perinatal period. More than 300 volunteers from more than 20 major medical institutions across the US have been involved in NPLD-GHI, including more than 25 OSUWMC medical personnel from anesthesiology, Ob/Gyn, and Labor & Delivery. As of 2014, we have visited 19 different Chinese hospitals. At 12 of these sites, NA rates have improved to>50% due to the outcomes of our program. Four impact studies in approximate 35,000 patients were performed in two of the hospitals showed an increase in NA of up to 60%. The results of these studies were presented at national and international anesthesia meetings documenting favorable maternal and newborn outcomes and reduction in Cesarean delivery. Data from NPLD-GHI was also used in my podium presentation at the 2013 SOAP conference on April 26, 2013 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which was chosen as the Best Paper Presentation. NPLD-GHI has changed obstetric anesthesia and obstetrics practice in a positive way at a national level in China where there are 20 million births a year. An estimated 1.5 million parturients annually will benefit by 2018. The NPLD-GHI project has decreased Cesarean delivery in the 19 participating hospitals by 15,000 this year. Approximately 10 countries and nearly 100 media venues have reported on our activities. This intervention has brought great credit to The Ohio State University throughout Asia. (http://osumcnews.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/osumc-promotes-safe-labor-in-china/).

Furthermore, as a regional director of Global Health Education Initiatives at OSUCOM, I have participated in creating affiliations with medical institutions across China that offer OSUCOM medical students unique learning opportunities to gain exposure to a wider variety of diseases and to observe the pathogenesis of diseases, both earlier and later manifestations of many illnesses, than could actually be experienced by our medical students if they remained in the U.S. Our medical students can now observe how physicians in China utilize limited resources to provide medical care to a large population, as well as learn about traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese culture. Such experiences allow students to display their commitment to social justice, help develop credentials for career advancement, and combine learning with travel. Since 2008, OSU medical students have chosen Global Health Education electives at all four affiliated medical schools in China (Wuhan University, Xian Jiaotong University, Wenzhou Medical University, and Zhejiang Chinese Medical University), with an average of 10 medical students participating each year. In order to ensure this opportunity is always available to our medical students, I continuously maintain and nurture the relationships between the OSUCOM and our affiliated medical schools in China. (http://medicine.osu.edu/orgs/globalhealth/pages/index.aspx).

My clinical responsibilities have mainly focused on obstetric anesthesia, regional anesthesia, and thoracic anesthesia. My in depth academic experience in obstetric anesthesia and my global health education experience made me acutely aware of the dilemmas of foreign populations that did not have the options of modern pain control. Throughout the years, I have developed a keen interest in public health, in particular, maternal and fetal health in the general populations of Asia. It became clear to me that it was more suitable for me to change my academic track to one that clearly had a clinical emphasis in order to facilitate my interests in the international public health aspects of anesthesiology.

My work in China has changed the Chinese medical establishment’s approach to obstetrical anesthesia, which has impacted that country’s public health significantly, as well as the individual lives of women. In return, the Chinese medical establishment has invited OSUCOM department Chairs, Deans, and various faculty members to lecture in China and to participate in research with Chinese medical teams. A significant number of Chinese physicians have visited OSUWMC. In other words, our university’s reputation in the eyes of those who practice on the Asian continent has been significantly enhanced. We at The Ohio State University now occupy a position of academic eminence in the eyes of Chinese anesthesiologists, obstetricians, and primary care practitioners. This, combined with our placement of OSUCOM medical students at Chinese medical institutions, thereby providing significant medical and cultural learning opportunities, is consistent with the clinical excellence required in my promotion track. I have been a party to many research papers and laboratory efforts, but this “Anesthesiology” public health endeavor in which I have involved in China has made a greater impact than I could ever have imagined.

Professional Interests Narrative
Clinical Anesthesia. The main focus of my clinical anesthesia includes obstetric anesthesia, regional anesthesia, and thoracic anesthesia. However, I also provide anesthesia service in other areas of clinical anesthesia.

My research is focused on effects of anesthetics on gastrointestinal function.

In the basic research area, I mainly use electrophysiological technique, molecular biology, biochemistry to study the function of the enteric nervous system in both animal and human.

I also participated, as a principle investigator, in several clinical studies, including sponsored multicenter studies on treatments of opioid induced gastrointestinal dysfunctions.
