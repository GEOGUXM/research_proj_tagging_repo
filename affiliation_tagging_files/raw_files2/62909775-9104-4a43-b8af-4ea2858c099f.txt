Professor; B.S., National Taiwan University; M.S., Brown University; Ph.D. in Applied Physics, Harvard University (1968).  From 1968 to 1993, he spent 25 years at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center as Research Staff Member in Physical Science Department.  During that period, he also served as Senior Manager of Thin Film Science Department and Materials Science Department for 10 years.  In September 1993, he joined the Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering at UCLA as full professor.   He is now a distinguished professor in both Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering at UCLA.  He is a Fellow of American Physical Society (APS), The Metallurgical Society (TMS), Materials Research Society (MRS), and an Overseas Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge University, UK .   He was president of MRS in 1981.  He is an academician of Academia Sinica, Republic of China, elected in 2002.  He received the 2013 John Bardeen Award of TMS.  He has over 500 journal publications with citations over 18,000 and h-factor of 74.
Research Interests
Our research interest is in wafer-based and flux-driven materials science. Modern microelectronic and opto-electronic devices are built on wafers, involving the growth or removal of mono-layers of atoms from the wafer surface or from an inter-phase interface. We deal with open systems having a constant wafer surface or interface, and the flux can be atoms, charges, or energy beams.
Our major research areas are (1) Lead (Pb)-free solder metallurgy and Cu-to-Cu direct bonding for 3D IC packaging technology in consumer electronic products, (2) Advanced materials reliability problems of microelectronic devices caused by irreversible processes, and (3) Nanoscale interdiffusion and reactions.
Areas of Dissertation Guidance
Nanoscale kinetic processes,  metal-silicon interfaces,  electromigration,  Pb-free interconnects,  Cu-to-Cu direct bonding.
