Karola Stotz
Karola Stotz
Karola came to Macquarie in 2014 as a senior lecturer and Templeton World Charity Foundation Fellow. She received her Masters in Anthropology from the University of Mainz, Germany and her PhD in Philosophy from the University of Ghent, Belgium. She has held positions at the Unit of History and Philosophy of Science at Sydney University, Pittsburgh University, the Cognitive Science Program at Indiana University. From 2008-2013 she was an ARC Australian Research Fellow at the University of Sydney, working on a 5 year discovery project entitled: "Postgenomic Perspectives on Human Nature". Her personal website can be found here.
Current Research
Karola is currently working on a Templeton World Charity Foundation project entitled: "Causal Foundations of Biological Information", which aims to ground the idea of biological information in contemporary philosophical work on the nature of causation.
Her other research interests are:
Philosophy of Biology: philosophical issues of developmental, evolutionary and molecular biology, developmental niche construction and non-genetic/epigenetic inheritance
Philosophy of Cognitive Science: 4E cognition (embodied, embedded, extended, enacted), neural plasticity, the evolution of cognition, theory of mind, animal cognition, minimal (bacterial) cognition
Philosophy of Science: reductionism versus emergence, integrative science and pluralism, causation (measuring differing degrees of causal influence), process philosophy, complex systems theory
