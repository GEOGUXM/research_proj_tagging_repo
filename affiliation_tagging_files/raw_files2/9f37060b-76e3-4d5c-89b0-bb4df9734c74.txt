Mark Wollaeger
Professor
I received my B.A. from Stanford University and my Ph.D. from Yale University, where I taught before coming to Vanderbilt in 1994. Currently I am Professor of English and teach graduate and undergraduate courses on Anglo-American modernism, modernist culture, twentieth-century British literature, and literary theory. I served as President of the Modernist Studies Association (MSA) in 2004-5 and in 2006 ran the MSA Book Prize.

My first book, Joseph Conrad and the Fictions of Skepticism, was published by Stanford University Press in 1990. I've also edited two books on Joyce: James Joyce's "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man": A Casebook (Oxford 2003) and Joyce and the Subject of History (co-editor with Victor Luftig and Robert Spoo, Michigan 1996). My articles on Joyce, Woolf, Conrad and others have appeared in journals such as Modernism / Modernity, Modern Language Quarterly, English Literary History, and James Joyce Quarterly.
My latest monograph, Modernism, Media, and Propaganda: British Narrative from 1900 to 1945, was published by Princeton University Press in December 2006 (paperback. 2008) and is currently being translated into Chinese for distribution on the mainland. More recently I edited, with the assistance of Matt Eatough, the Oxford Handbook of Global Modernisms (2012; paperback 2013), a collection of essays on global modernisms. I’m also working on a monograph about the roles particular literary modernists (Conrad, Joyce, and Lawrence, among others) have played in formation of modernism and postcolonial studies as fields. I am also founding co-editor, with Kevin Dettmar, of Modernist Literature & Culture, a book series from Oxford University Press
