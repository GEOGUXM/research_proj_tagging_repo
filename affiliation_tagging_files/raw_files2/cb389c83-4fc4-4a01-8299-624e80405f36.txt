Biographical details
My research interests lie in sixteenth and seventeenth-century English literature and culture, with a focus on Shakespearean drama. Specific interests include: constructions of the early modern nation; sovereignty; Restoration and eighteenth-century adaptations of Shakespeare and other early modern dramatists; contemporary performances of Shakespeare plays. Other interests include twentieth-century and contemporary British poetry, and contemporary gay fiction.

Current projects
Shakespeare's Body Parts
In this project, I examine body parts in Shakespeare’s English history plays: how they are represented and, particularly, how they are implicated in the discourses and practices of sovereign power.
Love, Desire, and Friendship Between Men in Restoration and Eighteenth-Century Adaptations of Shakespeare
In this project, I aim to make an intervention into histories of male-male relationships, variously construed as either homosocial or homoerotic, through analyzing Restoration and early eighteenth-century adaptations of earlier drama by Shakespeare and his contemporaries.
