Sleep Medicine Epidemiology

Research Interests
My research interest is in understanding the epidemiology of sleep disorders with particular emphasis on chronic partial sleep deprivation and obstructive sleep apnea and the potential effects of these disorders on metabolism. I have conducted inquiries into the long term health effects of curtailed sleep including defining effects on weight homeostasis, diabetes, heart disease, and mortality. I have investigated the association between long self-reported sleep durations and health outcomes to attempt to understand potential mediators of this relationship. I have also been interested in identifying genetic polymorphisms that predispose to the development of sleep apnea and polymorphisms that influence the risk of developing cardiovascular or metabolic complications from sleep apnea. Additional studies have investigated the relationship between sleep apnea and adipose tissue including levels of circulating adipokines and most recently gene expression in adipose tissue.
