Research and Teaching Interests:
I study young teens’ relationships with their peers, and how these relationships are related to the development and adaptive functioning of youth. A central goal of my work is to understand the conditions and consequences of person-group mismatch. Most of my research is conducted in school settings.
Guided by a social-contextual perspective, I conceptualize schools and classrooms as ecological niches shaped by peer interactions and relationships. Much of recent research pertains to bullying. I have examined both the motives predicting bullying perpetration (dominance) and the social-cognitive mechanisms (self-blame) underlying the emotional plight of the targets of bullying. I also conduct research on peer groups norms and how they are related to adolescent behavior. My current collaborative research follows a large, ethnically diverse sample of students from 26 middle schools to the end of high school, examining the effects of school ethnic diversity on friendship formation, social identity development, prejudice, mental health, and school success.
