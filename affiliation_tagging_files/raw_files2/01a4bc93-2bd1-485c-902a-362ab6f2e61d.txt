Biography
Alison W. Conner joined the faculty in 1995 after nearly twelve years of teaching and research in Asia. She earned her Ph.D. in Chinese and Southeast Asian history at Cornell University and her law degree at Harvard Law School, where she specialized in Asian and comparative law and was a research fellow in the East Asian Legal Studies Program. Following law school, she taught Chinese and East Asian history and then spent five years practicing law on Wall Street before moving to Asia in 1983.

During the 1983-84 academic year, she taught as a Senior Fulbright Professor at Nanjing University's Department of Law, in one of the first Fulbright groups to return to China after 1949.  From 1984 to 1986 she was a member of the Law Faculty of the National University of Singapore, teaching courses on Singapore law.  In 1986 she joined the University of Hong Kong's Faculty of Law, where she taught both Hong Kong and Chinese law as a tenured member of the faculty.  In 2004 she returned to China on her second Fulbright award and taught comparative law as a Fulbright Distinguished Lecturer in Law at Beijing's Tsinghua University;  since then she has continued to teach in other programs in Hong Kong and Australia.  During the spring 2014 and 2015 semesters, she was the resident director for the University’s study abroad semester in China, where she taught courses on U.S. and Chinese law.  In fall 2016, she was a visiting scholar at the National Taiwan University College of Law and then returned to the University of Hong Kong’s Faculty of Law as a visiting fellow.
At the Law School, Professor Conner has maintained her involvement in international legal education and exchange programs, including the LLM, AJD and SJD programs, in addition to programs for visiting professors and visiting scholars at the Law School.  Since 1995, she has also been an active member of the Board of Directors of the American Society of Comparative Law. From 2001 to 2003 she also served on the Society's Executive Committee and from 2008-2012 she served as its Secretary. 
Professor Conner writes on modern Chinese law and Chinese legal history, especially in areas relating to the legal profession and legal education  But she also maintains her broader interests in Asian history, art and cinema. Her most recent research has focused on the depiction of law and the legal system in Chinese movies, especially the pre-1949 films, which she loved when she first saw them in Hong Kong in the mid-1980s.  A frequent speaker on the topic, she served as co-convener of two law and film symposia (in 2012 and 2013) and organized the Law & Film Institute at the Law School.
