Biographical details
Craig Browne works in the area of critical social theory. He is currently finalising a book comparing influential contemporary social theories and extending his research into the relationship between recognition, symbolic power and social imaginaries. He has received funding for research comparing pragmatist notions of creative democracy with ideas of democratic creativity in contemporary French social and political thought. This research into creative democracy builds on his Ph.D. dissertation: Projects and Anticipations: a Comparative Analysis of Habermas’ and Giddens’ Conceptions of the Social.
