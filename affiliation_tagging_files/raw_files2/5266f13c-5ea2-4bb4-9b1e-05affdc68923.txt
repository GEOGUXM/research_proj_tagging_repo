  Travis Legleiter is a PhD candidate with Dr. Bill Johnson investigating the suitability of best management recommendations of growth regulator-tolerant cropping systems.  His project includes a long term investigation of temporal weed species shifts under the influence of heavy growth-regulator herbicide dependency in comparison to a fully integrated herbicide program that includes multiple herbicide sites of action.  Travis is also looking at the effects of low drift broadcast spray nozzles on herbicide deposition and absorption on Palmer amaranth, waterhemp, marestail, and giant ragweed at late post-emergence application timings.  Expected Graduation: May 2017
