  Our mission is to advance the understanding of genetically-related conditions through multi-disciplinary research.
40 scientific research groups work to understand the genetic foundations of human variation and disease.
The Centre for Personalised Medicine is a joint initiative of the WTCHG and St Anne's College to drive forward a more integrated and personalised approach to medicine and healthcare.
Oxford Genomics Centre provides support and scientific advice to scientists wanting to exploit the latest in high-throughput genomics techniques.
This four year DPhil programme in Genomic Medicine and Statistics trains future scientific leaders who will work at the cutting edge of genomics in biomedical research.
WTCHG is on the University of Oxford’s Old Road Campus in Headington,a leading centre of interdisciplinary biomedical research.

Red blood cell variation linked to natural malaria resistance
Updated 19/05/2017
Protection from the most severe form of malaria is linked with natural variation in human red blood cell genes. Led by Professor Dominic Kwiatkowski, researchers from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute have identified a genetic rearrangement of red blood cell glycophorin receptors that confers a 40% reduced risk from severe malaria.
Antibody genes influence forgotten heart disease
Updated 12/05/2017
New research finds genetic differences in antibody genes alter susceptibility to rheumatic heart disease, a forgotten inflammatory heart condition – known as ‘RHD’ – that is rife in developing countries. Rheumatic heart disease is triggered by ...
