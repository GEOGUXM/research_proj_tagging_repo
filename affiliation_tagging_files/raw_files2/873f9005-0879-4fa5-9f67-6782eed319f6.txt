Biography
Carly joined Durham University in 2014 as Lecturer in the International Relations of the Middle East. She received her PhD in International Studies from the University of Birmingham in 2013 and spent one year as a Visiting Fellow at the Middle East Centre, London School of Economics and Political Science while lecturing in Foreign Policy Analysis at City University, London.
Carly’s research is situated between the fields of Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA) and Conflict Resolution, with a particular focus on the Israel-Palestine conflict. She is currently involved in three research projects. The first is a single-authored monograph provisionally titled, Foreign Policy Analysis: Concepts and Comparisons with Palgrave Macmillan (2016), which provides an up-to-date programme for teaching the subject by drawing on contemporary research into 21st-Century foreign policy players, including non-state actors and international organizations. The second project is an adaptation of her PhD, which examined the role of political survival in British policy decision-making towards Palestine during the Mandate period. Finally, the third project is a long-term initiative that attempts to triangulate a diplomatic ‘ripe moment’ for negotiations in the Israel-Palestine conflict. In particular, she is interested in how, specifically, concerns for political survival interfere in the search for successful peace negotiations.
