  Research
My research program has focused on the characterization and application of bioactive phytochemicals. Specifically, my efforts have focused on three areas: 1) enhancing food safety and quality through the novel application of antimicrobials or pulsed light technology, 2) improvement of human and animal health by dietary bioactive compounds, and 3) utilization of bioactive compounds in non-food applications.
