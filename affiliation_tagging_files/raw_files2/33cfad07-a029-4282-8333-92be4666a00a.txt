P. Konstantina Kiousis
Dr. Kiousis is an applied economist with research interests in corporate performance, productivity, competition and economic policy in particular industries and in the overall economy. Generally, her research examines how firms create and protect knowledge to bolster profitability and potentially alter broader economic activity. In this context, she analyzes the impact of intellectual property protection on the competitive strategies of firms. Her current work examines the role executives play in creating corporate value, suggesting that seemingly abnormal gains in executive compensation are associated with gains created for corporate shareholders. Over the course of her career, Dr. Kiousis has taught courses in strategic management, macroeconomics, management consulting, and international business. She has been honored with distinguished teaching awards and supervised award-winning PhD students. Professor Kiousis is also strongly committed to guiding the business community and policy makers. She has also worked on a variety of consulting projects with clients ranging from Fortune 500 companies, such as Victoria's Secret, BankOne, Cardinal Health, and Swiss Re, to Silicon Valley startups and performance arts organizations.
