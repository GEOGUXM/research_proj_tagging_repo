Role
Rebecca Vine’s research explores the complexity of management control and the role of mediating technologies in steering conduct and shaping what counts as valuable in the delivery of major projects.
Policy themes focus on the failure of construction business models to deliver acceptable risk and cost structures and potential reform through different evaluative infrastructures and modes of risk governance to sustain co-production.   
Research Interests
Her PhD thesis "The Intelligent Client: Learning To Govern Through Numbers at Heathrow" studies Heathrow as a site for risk-control innovation over a 20 year period. The underlying themes include:
Governing risk in construction and the history of the broken business model
The evolution of calculable spaces, values and risk technologies
How calculative technologies balance multiple perspectives and enrol moral constraint & discovery in emergent settings
These themes are inspired by Innovation, STS and Accounting literature on governing risk and complex innovation through performable spaces. Some of the PhD fieldwork was undertaken in collaboration with the University of Edinburgh.
The supervisory team are Professor Paul Nightingale, Dr. Josh Siepel & Professor Trevor Hopper
