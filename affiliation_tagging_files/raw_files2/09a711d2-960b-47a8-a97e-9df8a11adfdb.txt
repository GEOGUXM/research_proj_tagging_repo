Barbara Will
A. and R. Newbury Professor of English
Associate Dean of Arts and Humanities (as of July 1, 2015)
I specialize in twentieth-century literature, culture, and history, with a comparative emphasis upon Anglo-American and French modernism.  I teach core courses in these areas, as well as in literary and feminist theory and theories of cosmopolitanism.  My current book project considers how expatriate writers responded to the Vichy regime in France.
