Research Interests
• Hip, knee and spine mechanics
• Causes and treatments of osteoarthritis
• Medical imaging and medical image processing
• Orthopaedic sports medicine
Selected Current Projects
• Evaluation of the link between the mechanical changes produced by high tibial osteotomy and cartilage health
• Development of new methods for measuring cartilage strain in the loaded hip joint using the Canada Light Source synchrotron
• Application of open MRI to visualize impingement between the femur and acetabulum in patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI)
• Development of a system for navigated resection of bone deformities associated with femoroacetabular impingement
• Exploration of links between bone architecture, joint mechanics, and cartilage degeneration
