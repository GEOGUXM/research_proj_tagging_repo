Profile

I work primarily with integrated pest management of dipteran species related to livestock animals. Especially the conditions between the individual pest species, its natural enemies, the environment and farming practice - all important parameters for the understanding of the pest species biology and consequent definition of an optimum control strategy. Specifically, I work on biological control of flies by means of naturally occurring parasitoids, including epidemiological studies of flies as potential vectors for the spread of e.g. Campylobacter. Lately, ecological studies of biting midges as vectors for the virus disease Bluetongue have been brought into focus. This disease, that strikes ruminants such as cattle, sheep, and goats, reached the Danish borders in 2007.
