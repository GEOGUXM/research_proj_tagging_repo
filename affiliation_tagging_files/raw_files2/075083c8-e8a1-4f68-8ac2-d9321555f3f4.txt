EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY
WALL LAB
Overview
We are a group of functional anatomists who work on a variety of questions related to understanding the mechanisms through which diet and feeding behaviors have shaped primate evolution. The diversity of primate diets and feeding mechanisms are reflected in the design of skull structures, and teeth and jaws comprise the most abundant fossil record of primate evolution.
