Lecturer, Earth Systems Program
Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Geological Sciences
Miles Traer received his B.A. in Geophysics from the University of California at Berkeley in 2005. After working at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory, he moved to Stanford University and joined the Tectonic Geomorphology Group as a research assistant. Building on his research in the Tectonic Geomorphology Group, Miles received his Ph.D. in Geological and Environmental Sciences from Stanford University in 2014. While completing his Ph.D., he also co-created the Generation Anthropcene podcast with fellow Ph.D. student Michael Osborne, a project that told audio stories about the science of Earth's changing surface geology. Miles continues his research on the evolution of the ocean floor and currently works as a science communicator and multimedia producer for the School of Earth Sciences.
