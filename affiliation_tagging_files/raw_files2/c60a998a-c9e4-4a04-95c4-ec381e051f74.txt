STEM Education Research Group
The Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Education Research Group (formerly SMEC) operates within the School of Education in the Humanities Faculty.
It offers postgraduate studies in the STEM areas, and has a national and international reputation for excellence in research and development.
Supervising one of the largest concentrations of postgraduate students specifically in the STEM education disciplines in the world, the STEM Group has PhD, EdD and MPhil students from all Australian states and territories and many overseas countries.
Our history
The STEM Group began as the Science and Mathematics Education Centre (SMEC) approximately 35 years ago within the Division of Engineering, Science and Computing as Curtin’s only exclusively postgraduate teaching area. The recent name change to the STEM Group reflects its move into the School of Education, and the broadening focus to address not only the independent STEM disciplines, but also integrated STEM approaches.
Our research structure
The STEM Education Group is structured to comprise a number of clusters of education researchers in the key relevant areas of:
Technology and engineering
Science
Mathematics
Digital technologies
Integrated STEM
We invite inquiries and suggested collaborations from national and international researchers and students working in any of the STEM areas.
