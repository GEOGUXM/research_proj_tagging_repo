I am a graduate student in the theory group at the UW. In 2011, I obtained a M.Sc. degree from Simon Fraser University, where I was very lucky to be advised by Gábor Tardos.

On the communication complexity of sparse set disjointness and exists-equal problems

We show that the r-round communication complexity of the k-disjointness problem is precisely Θ(k log(r) k) bits. Setting r = log* k, our upper bound gives an O(k)-bits, log* k-rounds protocol with error probability exponentially small in k. This improves the best previous protocol due to Håstad and Wigderson, which ran in O(log k) rounds and erred with constant probability.
Our lower bound applies even to the simpler task of computing the OR of k independent instances of equality. An important aspect of our work is that the lower bound we get is super-linear in k, even though a single instance of equality can be solved with O(1) bits and constant error probability.
