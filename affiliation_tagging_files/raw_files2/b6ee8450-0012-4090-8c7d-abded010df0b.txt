The growing epidemic of the metabolic syndrome is a critical health care issue affecting the quality of life for millions of individuals. A predominant factor associated with the metabolic syndrome is dysregulated fuel metabolism. The general aim of our research has been to understand the control of inter-organ fuel metabolism with particular emphasis on the regulation of glucose flux by insulin. The approach is to utilize dietary manipulations and pharmacological intervention to perturb metabolic systems in various mouse models. Our laboratory has developed state-of-the-art chronic catheterization techniques that allow for the assessment of insulin action in vivo in unstressed, non-restrained conscious mice using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.
JULIO AYALA'S RESEARCH REPORT
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a gut-secreted peptide that enhances the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells in response to nutrient intake. Because of this incretin effect, GLP-1 action is an attractive target for anti-diabetic therapies. Evidence from our group indicates that signaling through the GLP-1 receptor (Glp1r) also modulates insulin action in the liver and skeletal muscle independent of its ability to stimulate insulin secretion. Interestingly, the Glp1r is not expressed in either the liver or skeletal muscle. However, the Glp1r is expressed in hypothalamic nuclei that play a role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. The Glp1r is also expressed in brain regions involved in the control of food intake and motivated behavior. Therefore, this presents an exciting opportunity for future research into the role of this incretin hormone to regulate various aspects of fuel metabolism.
