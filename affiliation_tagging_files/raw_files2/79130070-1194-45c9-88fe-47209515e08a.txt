Dr Teea Palo
Lecturer
Research Interests
My research looks at business models as devices used by market actors in forming networks and constructing markets. In particular, I am interested in the dynamic, processual, and interactive nature of business models instead of their mere structure. More recently, I have started to look at the role of narratives in networks and markets; the ways in which individuals, groups and organizations develop and use narratives in imagining future markets and shaping the actions of others in constructing those markets. I am also interested in service networks, and have also looked at the implementation of key account management programs within professional service organizations.
In conducting my research, I have worked in multiple applied research consortium projects with companies mainly from the Information Technology sector facilitating their business model and service business development. Currently I am looking at eHealth markets and the development of preventive healthcare services. I am also starting a research project on the study of constructing temporal markets for Christmas in the Northern Finland, Lapland.
