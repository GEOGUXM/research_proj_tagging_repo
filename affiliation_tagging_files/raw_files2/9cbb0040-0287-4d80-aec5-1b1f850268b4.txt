  Research Abstracts:
By using "design of catalysts as artificial enzymes" and "environmentally-benign organic synthesis" as two important key-words, the synthetic organic chemistry laboratory focuses on the following topics:
1 Design of Chiral Phase Transfer Catalysts for Practical Amino Acid
Synthesis
2 Design of Chiral Organocatalysts for Practical Asymmetric Synthesis
3 Development of Bidentate Lewis Acid Chemistry and Application to
Selective Organic Synthesis

Based on the conceptually new approaches, we will seek the clear-cut solution of the basic and essential problems in organic chemistry, and aim at the new and dynamic development of modern organic synthesis.
