Tamsin's Researcher Profile
  Biography
Tamsin joined Monash University’s School of Nursing and Midwifery in 2012, and previously worked as a clinical nurse educator in a busy Melbourne tertiary emergency department. (ED) Tamsin has an extensive background in emergency nursing, is passionate about emergency/trauma nursing and continues to work clinically.
Tamsin’s involvement in the ‘Health for the South’ project in Sri Lanka and India has developed a keen interest in the research of emergency nursing in developing countries. In addition, Tamsin’s other research interests include the education of emergency nurses, simulation and the patient journey through the ED. Tamsin has also completed an Honours thesis which was titled “The experience and adjustment of women following their first acute myocardial infarction”.
