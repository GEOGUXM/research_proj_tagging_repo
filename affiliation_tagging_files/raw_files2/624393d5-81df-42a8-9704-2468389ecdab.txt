Profile
Sara's research interests are based in cognitive science. She studied for her Maîtrise in psychology and cognitive neuroscience at the University of Paris 8 while on placement at the Salpêtrière Hospital's Brain Imaging Unit. Sara then gained her Masters and PhD at the Rutgers University Center for Cognitive Science working with preschool children in schools throughout New Jersey. This led on to a three-year ESRC-funded postdoctoral research position within the University of Bristol's Cognitive Development Centre. Between 2007 and 2010 she was an invited lecturer at the Royal College of Psychiatrists teaching basic psychology. Sara held a lectureship in Developmental Psychology at the University of Salford for one year before joining the University of Cambridge Faculty of Education as a University Lecturer in October 2011.  Sara is a PI in the recently established Centre for Research on Play in Education, Development and Learning.

Research Areas
The focus of Sara's research is belief formation and belief revision, particularly during the preschool years when children learn about a constantly changing world.  Central to her research agenda is the role of cognitive flexibility in the formation and expression of beliefs about two core domains of knowledge: the social world (e.g., perspective-taking) and the physical world (e.g., gravity and inertia). How do children discover the general laws underlying these domains?  How entrenched are their beliefs and what kinds of evidence are needed to revise these?  In addition to basic research, Sara translates research from cognitive development into educational contexts.  What types of strategies can children use to solve everyday problems more effectively, and how can adults support this?  Later in development, what are the key factors in adults’ use of evidence-based reasoning (e.g. critical thinking and scientific reasoning)?  Sara's recent projects addressing questions like these have been funded by the Newton Trust, a Cambridge Humanities Research Grant, and the LEGO Foundation.
