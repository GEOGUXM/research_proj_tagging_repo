Short presentation
My main interest is virtue and moral psychology both from a historical and a contemporary perspective. In my master thesis I focused on Tomas Aquinas' account of emotions and their role in a virtuous life (defended 2011). The dissertation project concerns the foundational issues in virtue theory of Aquinas and Godfrey of Fontaine. I am interested in the principles behind how moral virtues are distinguished from each other and how ultimately, they are all dependent on each other.
