Profile
My research focus is in Quaternary science, in particular geoarchaeology and the Palaeolithic record in Britain. I have been involved in a number of major UK Palaeolithic archaeological research projects; I am currently a member of the Pathways to Ancient Britain Project and Principal Investigator on the Breckland Palaeolithic Project (2016-19), funded by the Leverhulme Trust.  I am a Co-Investigator on the Mapping Palaeolithic Britain Project, also funded by the Leverhulme Trust and a Co-director of the Barnham Excavation. I am also involved in the Happisburgh Palaeolithic Project and the recent discovery of ancient footprints at Happisburgh received the Current Archaeology 2015 “Rescue Dig of the Year” award.  I was awarded the Henry Stopes Medal by the Geologists’ Association in 2015. I was a member of the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain (AHOB) Project (2001-12), funded by the Leverhulme Trust.
