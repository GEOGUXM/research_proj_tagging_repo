Curriculum Vitae
Education: 
B.A., Hamline University, 1995; M.P.H., Columbia University, 2003; Ph.D., Columbia University, 2007; Robert Wood Johnson Health and Society Scholar, University of Michigan, 2007-10
Area(s) of Specialization: 
Environmental Epigenetics, Toxicology, Nutrition, DNA Methylation, Molecular Epidemiology
Research Description: 
J. Richard Pilsner is a molecular epidemiologist committed to investigating how environmental and nutritional factors influence health outcomes via epigenetic processes. Epigenetic plays an important role in the functionality of DNA by controlling how genes are expressed. Dr. Pilsner’s environmental epigenetic laboratory has state-of-the-art equipment for high-throughput DNA methylation analyses tailored to population-based research.
