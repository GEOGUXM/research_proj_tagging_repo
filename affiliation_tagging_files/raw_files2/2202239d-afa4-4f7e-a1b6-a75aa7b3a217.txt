Professor Richard Lucas
Expertise
• Remote sensing and biogeography
• Terrestrial ecosystem response to change
• Vegetation carbon dynamics
• Land cover and change mapping
Profile
The primary area of Professor Lucas’ expertise is in quantifying and understanding the response of terrestrial ecosystems and environments to change, including that associated with climatic variation, through integration of remote sensing data from various sources. He has also developed methods for extracting relevant information on terrestrial ecosystems at scales ranging from individual trees to entire regions. Key achievements include the development of object-based methods to update a national classification of habitats in Wales (UK) and a generic scheme for classifying land covers at any location and at multiple scales based on the FAO Land Cover Classification System (LCCS); implementing approaches to quantifying the biomass and structure of forests and woodlands in eastern Australia through integration of radar, optical and ICESAT data; and quantifying mangrove response to both natural and anthropogenic change, including that associated with climatic fluctuation. His collaborative research on lidar and hyperspectral data has established innovative techniques for characterising the species composition, structure and biomass of Australian woodlands at the tree and stand level and quantifying change.
Professor Lucas’ has developed a range of techniques for retrieving information on the state and dynamnics of terrestrial vegetation and his current research is increasingly focusing on using these to better understand the impacts of human-induced and natural change on a diversity of ecosystems, including mangroves, semi-arid woodlands and tropical rainforests. His research is also establishing how time-series of optical and radar remote sensing data can be used to restore previously lost or degraded ecosystems for the benefit of biodiversity conservation and carbon preservation and sequestration.
