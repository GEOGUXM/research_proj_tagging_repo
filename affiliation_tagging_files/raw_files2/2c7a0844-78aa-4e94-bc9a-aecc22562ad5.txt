Biography
Sergii Veremieiev obtained his Bachelor and Master degrees, both in Physics, from Donetsk National University in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Then he moved to the UK to undertake a PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering in the University of Leeds under the EST Marie Curie Research Programme. Upon completion of his PhD in 2011, he took up a research fellow position in Leeds to work in the area of Computational Fluid Dynamics. Late in 2013 he joined Liverpool John Moores University to work as a Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering. In January 2015 he started a Lectureship at the School of Engineering and Computing Sciences of Durham University.
Research Interests
Fluid mechanics, in particular stability analysis and modelling of free-surface and two-phase fluid flows with moving contact lines, such as thin films, droplets and rivulets, encountered in engineering and biologically related applications
Numerical analysis, development and coding of partial differential equation solvers, such as multigrid, multifrontal and generalised minimal residual methods, high performance computing.
