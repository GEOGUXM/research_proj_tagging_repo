Biography:
I am an Independent Research Fellow funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) in the School of Psychology & Neuroscience at the University of St. Andrews. I did my B.Sc. (2000-2003) and M.Sc. degrees (2003-2005) at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, my Ph.D. (2005-2010) at McGill University in Canada, and my first post-doc (2010-2012) at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. I am now a visiting Research Fellow in this Department, hosted by Nick Davies.

Research Interests
I am generally interested in the evolution of cognition and the developmental determinants of cognitive performance. Thus far I have studied quite a diverse array of topics, ranging from insect communication to bird song learning and mate choice for cognitive traits, the existence of a "general cognitive ability", to social learning and the spread of information through animal groups. I am currently focussing on how developmental factors affect (social) information use, social network positions and proxies of fitness. I greatly enjoy collaborating with researchers in the UK and abroad. I also enjoy teaching and mentoring students, and have taught courses at McGill University, Cambridge University and the University of St. Andrews.
