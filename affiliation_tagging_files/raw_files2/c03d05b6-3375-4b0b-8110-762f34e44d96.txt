Antaki, James F.
Professor of Biomedical Engineering
Ph.D., 1991, University of Pittsburgh
http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/antaki/
Publications
Highlights:
Medical devices of the future will face a myriad of new challenges – not only technical, but financial and sociological. Professor Antaki is devoting his career to meeting such challenges by developing a new approach for translating medical discoveries to clinical practice: one that is more holistic, prescriptive, multi-scale and multi-disciplinary. His research emphasizes the methodology by which medical inventions are conceptualized, optimized, and implemented. The current application areas include: circulatory support systems for children, decision-support tools for personalized management of cardiac disease, multi-scale modeling of thrombosis, and medical devices for global health. An overarching interest is developing an infrastructure for crowd-sourced medical innovation that may ultimately contribute to more effective, preventative, and affordable healthcare, particularly in under-resourced settings.

Bettinger, Christopher J.
Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Materials Science & Engineering
Ph.D., 2008, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
http://biomicrosystems.net/
Publications
Highlights:
The next generation of bio-integrated electronic devices will be important for use in applications ranging from controlled release systems to brain-machine interfaces. Integration of devices with the human body can be achieved by engineering the abiotic-biotic interface. The group of Professor Bettinger synthesizes new materials and structures that seamlessly meld the tissue-device interface to improve the efficacy of medical devices. The research is focused on the design and synthesis of ultra-compliant biocompatible electronic conductors for soft tissue interfaces, and edible electronics for non-invasive device deployment. These efforts will reduce the cost and improve the delivery of healthcare to many patient populations.
Professor Bettinger is a recipient of the IUPAC Prize for Young Chemists, the American Chemical Society AkzoNobel Award, and the Technology Review TR35 Award.

Bruchez, Marcel P.
Associate Professor of Chemistry, Biological Sciences, and Biomedical Engineering
Ph.D., 1998, University of California, Berkeley
http://www.chem.cmu.edu/groups/bruchez/
Publications
Highlights:
The research of Professor Bruchez has focused on the development of highly sensitive fluorescence labeling methods that can be used without any washing, to directly report on cellular activity or physiology in intact cells, tissues or organisms. His group has used a combination of genetically encoded tags and environmentally sensitive dyes to establish a broadly applicable toolset for imaging multicellular processes and local physiology in complex multicellular systems. These tools have revealed fundamental trafficking processes and new modes of intercellular antigen transfer, enabling new approaches to vaccine and therapeutic development. Professor Bruchez, a Technology Review “Top 100 Young Innovators” honoree, holds 23 patents.

Cai, Yang G.
Senior Systems Scientist, CyLab
Associate Research Professor, Biomedical Engineering
Ph.D., 1997, West Virginia University
http://www.cmu.edu/vis
Publications
Highlights:
The research of Professor Cai is focused on biomedical video analytics and interactive visualization that combines human motion perception and machine vision, as a part of “Instinctive Computing” (Springer-Verlag, 2016). His current project is to develop a computational “dashboard” to measure the quality of diagnostic examinations from real-time colonoscopy videos in endoscopy labs. He has also been working on “Ambient Diagnostics” (CRC, 2014) for affordable medical diagnoses using mobile devices, webcam, smart tattoo, pill camera, and social media. He has developed a computational tongue diagnosis method based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). In addition, he has worked on privacy algorithms in human imaging, digital human modeling, and game-based biomedical simulation.

Campbell, Phil G.
Research Professor, Biomedical Engineering, Engineering Research Accelerator, Biological Sciences, Materials Science & Engineering
Ph.D., 1985, Pennsylvania State University
http://www.ices.cmu.edu/phil_campbell.html
Publications
Highlights:
Professor Campbell has over 25 years’ experience in multidisciplinary research with both engineers and clinicians to develop unique solutions to a wide variety of complex biomedical problems, including the development of natural-based biomaterials, implant biocompatibility, and tissue engineering. One of his overarching research themes involves understanding and engineering the cellular microenvironment from an endocrine point of view, both in vitro and in vivo. The study encompasses growth factor interstitial transport, interactions with receptors and non-receptor binding proteins, immobilization and proteolytic processing of extracellular matrix bound growth factors and other signaling molecules, and live cell and animal imaging. His research has taken advantage of biopatterned microenvironments to spatially deliver signaling molecules to spatially control cell behavior in vitro and tissue formation in vivo toward musculoskeletal, cardiac, immunological and cancer applications.

Chase, Steven M.
Assistant Professor, Biomedical Engineering and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition
Ph.D., 2006, Johns Hopkins University
http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~schase
Publications
Highlights:
Brain-computer interface, or BCIs, are a promising technology for alleviating motor deficits caused by injury or disease. These devices can read out motor intent by recording directly from populations of motor cortical neurons, and use this information to actuate an external device, such as a computer cursor or robotic limb. In addition, BCIs can also be used as a unique tool for probing brain processes that would otherwise remain covert. The research group of Professor Chase has two main thrusts. The first is to develop novel computational and experimental techniques that leverage BCIs as a research tool for investigating the neural correlates of motor learning, adaptation, and the representation of motor intent. The second is to design new BCI decoding algorithms to enhance the performance of these devices, and hasten their clinical translation.

Cook, Keith E.
Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering
Ph.D., 2000, Northwestern University
Publications
Highlights:
Professor Keith Cook’s research applies biomedical engineering to cardiac and pulmonary diseases. His laboratory’s goal, therefore, is to generate new devices, treatment strategies, and diagnostic tools and translate them to the clinic.
Current research projects in his group include thoracic artificial lungs, perfluorocarbon emulsions for pulmonary drug delivery, new biomaterial approaches for reducing coagulation at artificial surfaces, and PET-based diagnostic tools for right ventricular dysfunction. Of note, his laboratory was the first to produce 24 hour, week, and 30-day in vivo studies of thoracic artificial lungs, and his group is working on a artificial lung intended as destination therapy for years of respiratory support. Professor Cook currently serves as an editor of the American Society of Artificial Internal Organs Journal.

Dahl, Kris N.
Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, and Materials Science & Engineering
Ph.D., 2004, University of Pennsylvania
http://dahl.cheme.cmu.edu/
Publications
Highlights:
The research of Professor Kris Noel Dahl is focused on the structural and rheological properties of the cellular nucleus and cytoskeleton. In deciphering the structural and mechanical elements of the cell's nucleus, she adds needed insight into the roles of epigenetic regulation, stem cell differentiation, aging pathologies, and cancer progression and metastases. The integration of the cytoskeleton and nucleus provides a unique perspective into mechanical transmission of forces that influence genome expression.
Over the years Professor Dahl’s research has spanned molecular, organelle, cellular, and multicellular length scales, using a combination of spectroscopic, imaging, biophysical, and computational approaches. Prof. Dahl's group has received funding from the NIH, Progeria Research Foundation, DOD, and NSF including an NSF CAREER award.
