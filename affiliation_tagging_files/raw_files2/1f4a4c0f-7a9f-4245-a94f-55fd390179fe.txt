TEACHING
Inorganic Chemistry, Advanced Topics in Inorganic Chemistry, Environmental Chemistry, Synthetic Methods, General Chemistry
RESEARCH INTERESTS
Solid state inorganic chemistry, materials and nanoparticle research.
Research in the Stoll Lab has focused on the synthesis and study of magnetic nanoparticles. Magnetic nanoparticles are of interest for electronics applications (data storage), biological systems (particularly for separations and MRI), as well as fundamental questions about magnetism on the nanometer length scale. Many of our projects involve the synthesis of novel magnetic nanoparticles or the incorporation of magnetic clusters and nanoparticles in larger superstructures. We are also interested in developing systems with novel magneto-optical, luminescence, non-linear optical properties.
