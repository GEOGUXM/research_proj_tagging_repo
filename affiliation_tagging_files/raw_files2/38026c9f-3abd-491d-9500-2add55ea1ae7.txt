RESEARCH INTERESTS
Inequality is the connecting thread of Gordon Waitt’s research. My current work develops this interest in inequality through three strands. Each strand addresses urgent sustainability challenges:
Household Sustainability: This work explores the question: Who is doing the work of household sustainability? I explore this question through investigating who is involved in various everyday practices including driving, preparing meals, preserving food and making decisions about what is and is not rubbish. Everyday mundane practices are repositioned as key in household sustainability debates.
Fuel Poverty: Key to this work is the question: What can we learn from older low income household to address fuel poverty? Rather than positioning people as a problem that has to be fixed through energy efficiency policies, this project starts with the assumption that people are part of the solution to fuel poverty. Hence, the aim of this work is to better understand how energy is used to make places called home. Equipped with this knowledge, policy makers can more informed energy policies.
Urban Revitalisation: The starting point for this research is the question: How can we make regional city centre more lively places? This project sits with wider concerns that not everybody has equal access to city centres. Attention turns to how different process of discrimination and marginalisation operate through impressions, transport modes and routes or pathways.
