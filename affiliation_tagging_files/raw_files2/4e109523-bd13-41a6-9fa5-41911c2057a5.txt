Research interests
I am mainly interested in the ecology of plant–animal interactions on tropical islands. My work focuses on the applications of field studies at different levels of ecological organisation to inform conservation and invasive species management.

My current project focuses on the study of animal-mediated seed dispersal of fleshy-fruited plants. Specifically, I am using the Aldabra Atoll in the Western Indian Ocean, and its vertebrate frugivores and fleshy-fruited plants, as a model system to investigate seed dispersal on multiple levels of ecological organization.
My project has four intimately linked research foci:
assess the structure of the frugivore–plant interaction network of Aldabra;
test the effects of giant tortoise gut passage on seed germination and seedling establishment of Solanum aldabrensis;
(3) assess the effects of giant tortoise-mediated seed deposition on the spatial distribution of plants by constructing and experimentally field-test a mechanistic, individual-based and spatially explicit model;
and study the consequences of seed dispersal on the spatial distribution and population connectivity of the highly frugivore-dependent S. aldabrensis using genetic techniques.
