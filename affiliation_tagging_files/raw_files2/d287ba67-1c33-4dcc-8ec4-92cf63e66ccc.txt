Key Research Interests
Research interests are focused on plant carbohydrate metabolism with a specific interest in photosynthesis. We have a general interest in understanding the biochemical and molecular basis of plant responses to their environment (e.g. CO2, light, nutrients), how this is signaled and the subsequent effects on both cellular metabolism and plant development.
More recently we have employed new technologies (micro array and mass spectrometry) to widen our understanding of the regulation of plant processes.
